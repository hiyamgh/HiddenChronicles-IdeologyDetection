# Sequential Modelling of the Evolution of Word Representations for Semantic Change Detection
Python code for the paper *"Sequential Modelling of the Evolution of Word Representations for Semantic Change Detection"* by Tsakalidis & Liakata (EMNLP 2020) [1]. The four folders contain the following:
- **data**: contains the data (words, labels, train/test indices) that were used in the paper;
- **models**: contains the source code for the models that were employed in the experimnents (one file per model);
- **evaluation_scripts**: functions to use for evaluating the performance of a model;
- **synthetic_data_scripts**: used for the synthetic data part of the paper (section 4 of the paper).

## Data
First, download the word vectors from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/d9cmc8kied74hiv/AABT5z1Z67MJ7KChIXWRUvO9a?dl=0) (~250MB) and extract the *vectors.p* file within the */data/* folder. These vectors have been originally generated in [2] (100-dim representations in 14 consecutive years: 2000-2013). The rest of the folder contains the following:
- **words.p**: a list with the actual words.
- **labels.p**: list of labels ("static" or "change"); there is one label per word.
- **train_idx**: the indices of the words/vectors/labels that were used for training purposes.
- **test_idx**: the indices of the words/vectors/labels that were used for evaluation purposes.

Note that there is a one-to-one mapping across the indices of these pickles.

## Models
This folder contains the code for the models that were tested in [1]. Each file is self-contained (i.e., you can test out a model by calling the respective "main" function). Each model has a **"TEST_ON"** variable which needs to be set. For the definition of the TEST_ON variable and its correct use, refer to the Supplementary Material in [1]. It has been currently set as to operate in the full sequence of word vectors for each model invidivually (i.e., s.t. each model identifies word with altered/shifted semantics during the full time period under consideration).

## Evaluation Scripts
The code for evaluating each model. Use the *"evaluation_NNs.py"* for evaluating the neural-based models; for the rest, use the *"evaluation_baselines.py"*.
