"(Reuters Health) - With recent revelations that U.S. law enforcement can - and already has - dipped into consumer genealogy DNA databases to help solve crimes, experts say more discussion of the ethical issues raised by this unintended use of personal information is needed.",Main
"It’s unclear, for instance, whether online genealogy site users know their DNA is available to criminal investigators - and whether they’d object to it being used for that purpose, write the authors of an essay exploring the topic in the Annals of Internal Medicine.",Main
“We’re seeing a divide about this right now.,Distant_Evaluation
"On one hand, it’s a powerful technology to solve cases, but it also raises questions for consumers,” said lead author Benjamin Berkman, who heads the section on the ethics of genetics and new technologies at the National Institutes of Health’s Department of Bioethics in Bethesda, Maryland.",Distant_Evaluation
"“The idea that they upload their data for genealogy purposes and it’s used in such a different way really surprises some people,” he told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.",Distant_Evaluation
"“The terms of service agreements don’t explain this clearly, and even if they did, people wouldn’t read it or find it in the dense legalese.”",Distant_Evaluation
"Berkman and his co-authors were moved to write about the issue after the April arrest of a 72-year-old man suspected of being the Golden State Killer, a serial rapist and murderer who committed at least 12 murders, more than 50 rapes and more than 100 burglaries in California from 1974 to 1986.",Cause_Specific
Police detectives had compared DNA from several crime scenes against online DNA-genealogy data to track down this suspect.,Cause_General
"Although investigators have long used DNA for forensic purposes, they have typically compared samples to databases created specifically for criminal justice purposes, the authors note.",Main
"And in the realm of scientific and medical research, people who provide samples have clear expectations for “informed consent.” They want researchers to ask permission, but are generally comfortable with giving it for wide-ranging research uses of the material.",Distant_Evaluation

"It can result in arrests of guilty relatives for crimes they committed but also potentially false-positives mistakenly identifying innocent people, the study authors note.",Main
"When investigators conduct forensics research with genealogy DNA, they may also interview suspects and contact relatives to obtain more information.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Since law enforcement agencies haven’t been clear about how these investigations are conducted, it’s tough to debate whether these communications are harmful or an ethical quandary, said Stephanie Malia Fullerton of the University of Washington School of Medicine’s Department of Bioethics and Humanities, who wasn’t involved in the essay.",Distant_Evaluation
"“We don’t actually know how many people who have placed their data in these online databases are subject to forensic uses,” she said in a telephone interview.",Distant_Evaluation
"“We also don’t know how these partial genetic matches are used, and we can speculate about the possible harms, but we don’t know what exactly is involved or who is contacted.”",Distant_Evaluation
"Berkman and his colleagues note that, under legal theory, people have no reasonable expectation of privacy for “abandoned” materials such as hair or nail clippings or cigarette butts.",Main
"Courts have allowed law enforcement officials to test DNA left behind in different settings, and it can be argued that since users voluntarily upload their DNA into online commercial databases, the legal implications may be simpler to understand than the ethical ones.",Main
"In the future, a commitment to transparency is important, they write.",Main
Researchers should begin to study how many law enforcement agencies use forensic DNA searching and how they do it.,Main

"(Reuters) - Global warming has increased the likelihood of more massive, sluggish storms like Florence, capable of dropping record amounts of rain and causing the type of catastrophic flooding that crippled North and South Carolina this week, experts said.",Main
Most meteorologists agree that climate change can increase the volume of water vapor stored within weather systems.,Cause_Specific
"More water vapor means more rain, especially when the storm is a crawler like Florence, which slowed to about 2 miles per hour (3.2 km per hour) after slamming into the North Carolina coast.",Cause_Specific
"When storms such as Harvey, which struck Texas last year, and Florence come to a virtual stall, a deluge of rain can fall in the matter of days, equal to what an area typically sees in a year, they said.",Distant_Evaluation
"“It is compelling and sobering to see these storms come in back-to-back seasons,” said Jim Kossin, an atmospheric research scientist with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",Distant_Evaluation
His research suggests that global warming has affected the speed of storms as well as the amount of moisture they contain.,Distant_Evaluation
"Florence, which has killed at least 36 people, dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday.",Cause_General
"At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage, with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said.",Cause_General
"It has been a little more than a year since Hurricane Harvey dumped trillions of gallons of water on Texas and the U.S. Gulf Coast, killing 68 people and causing an estimated $125 billion in property damage.",Distant_Historical
"Based on data from about seven decades of storms, Kossin found tropical-cyclone speed had decreased globally by 10 percent from 1949 to 2016, according to a paper published in June in the scientific journal Nature.",Cause_General
"The reason is that climate change is warming the Arctic much more than it is heating up the Tropics, easing the pressure difference between the two, he said in an interview on Wednesday.",Cause_Specific
"Pressure differences drive the winds, which in turn can steer and slow down storms, he said.",Cause_Specific
"In the case of Florence, warmer sea temperatures and the amount of available moisture in the air may have increased rainfall by as much as 50 percent in the hardest-hit areas, according to a study by researchers at Stony Brook University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.",Distant_Evaluation
"To make matters worse, Florence was about 50 miles (80 km) larger in diameter due to global warming, putting more people in harm’s way, the study showed.",Distant_Evaluation
"“We can attribute that additional rainfall to human-induced climate change,” said Kevin Reed, a professor at Stony Brook University’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, who contributed to the study.",Distant_Evaluation
"The paper, still unpublished, may fuel an ongoing debate in the scientific community about whether climate change, induced by human activity, has a direct impact on the strength and size of a storm.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Global warming has greatly increased the chances of another storm of Harvey’s magnitude hitting Texas again, according to a published study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Kerry Emanuel.",Distant_Evaluation
"The likelihood of more massive rainfalls also should raise red flags for both coastal and inland communities and get them to rethink plans for storm-related inundation, experts said.",Distant_Evaluation
This includes planning for massive evacuations and making improvements to infrastructure related to water-flow resources to help ease the blow.,Distant_Evaluation

"His group has weighed in with far-reaching recommendations, and other groups are preparing proposals of their own.",Cause_General
"The mayor's commission also proposed a network of dams that would block or slow the opening between the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal and Lake Pontchartrain, and block storm surges from flowing up the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a navigation channel that has been blamed for a storm surge funnel effect that increased the damage to eastern New Orleans.",Main
The group is also calling for long-term flood-control structures that would block or slow surges at the two passes between Lake Pontchartrain and the Gulf of Mexico.,Main
"The fast-track structures would cost $100 million to $170 million, according to the commission's estimates, a fraction of the $3.1 billion the federal government has proposed spending on flood control measures in the area.",Main

Mr. Hitchings said that the corps was slightly behind schedule but that he expected things to move quickly.,Distant_Evaluation

"Without air-conditioning, toxic mold flourished in the 90-degree heat and the damp conditions that followed Frances, ruining expensive paint finishes, playing havoc with antique furniture and forcing some collectors to send paintings to the restorer.",Cause_General
The long wait for electricity prompted several moguls to buy generators large enough to power a tropical mansion.,Cause_General
"The generators usually take up at least 100 square feet, Mr. Nievera said, and are often seven feet tall.",Distant_Evaluation
"They cost an average of $30,000, which does not include the cost of obtaining permits, digging trenches and other aspects of installation.",Cause_General

"Government complacency, poor planning and dereliction of duty during Hurricane Katrina contributed to the deaths of dozens of the frail and sick in New Orleans, and to the suffering of many others who were stranded in area hospitals and nursing homes unable to care for them, Senate investigators said Tuesday.",Main
"In the second day of Senate hearings on the hurricane response, the focus was on what investigators called perhaps the most outrageous chapter of the storm: the mistreatment of nursing home and hospital patients during the disaster.",Main

''Why were so many left behind?'',Cause_General
"The witnesses acknowledged a long list of failures that meant there was no coordinated or tested plan in place to evacuate the frail, sick or poor, though studies had warned for more than a decade that an estimated 100,000 New Orleans residents without transportation would need such help in a major hurricane.",Cause_Specific
"As a result, patients sat in hospitals and nursing homes for days without electricity, fuel, air-conditioning or sufficient food, the witnesses and senators said.",Cause_Specific

"''We had no plans in place to do any of this,'' he said.",Cause_Specific
"Instead, he testified Tuesday, his focus was on improving the plan for the mass evacuation of the general population, creating a system that opened all the major highway lanes moving away from New Orleans.",Cause_General
This ''contraflow'' plan is credited with helping perhaps 1.2 million area residents get out of harm's way.,Cause_General
"Dr. Kevin U. Stephens, director of the New Orleans Health Department, testified that starting in late 2004 he had tried to create his own plan with bus companies, riverboat owners and Amtrak to evacuate the city's ''special needs'' population.",Cause_General
"But the negotiations were not complete when Hurricane Katrina hit, Dr. Stephens said, in part because of liability questions.",Cause_Specific
"Nursing homes, meanwhile, were each supposed to have evacuation plans.",Cause_General
"At hospitals, because some patients would inevitably be deemed too ill to move, backup generators were to be in place so care could be provided during and after the storm.",Cause_General
"But both plans failed, the investigators were told, in a breakdown that had been predicted in regional hurricane emergency drills.",Cause_Specific
"First, only 21 percent of area nursing homes, or nearly 60, evacuated before the storm; one witness said this occurred because in the past, nursing homes were not reimbursed for the cost of the evacuation if the predicted storm did not hit.",Cause_General
"And many hospitals ignored years of warnings to put generators and electrical switching equipment in places protected from flooding, the witnesses said.",Cause_General
"Once the storm had passed and the city had flooded, even though thousands of patients needed to be evacuated, nursing home operators often could not call for help.",Distant_Historical
"Even when the requests got through, they were not given a high priority, testified Joseph A. Donchess, executive director of the Louisiana Nursing Home Association.",Distant_Evaluation
"Extraordinary suffering and even death resulted, Mr. Donchess said.",Distant_Evaluation

Louisiana statistics released this week show that nearly 70 percent of the 796 deceased Hurricane Katrina victims identified as of late January were 61 years old or older.,Cause_General
"Senator Collins read an e-mail exchange that took place two days before the hurricane hit, in which an official of the federal Department of Health and Human Services asked a Louisiana official if help was needed ''for patient movement/evacuation or anything else.''",Cause_General
"The response, an e-mail message from the federal official said, was that ''they do not require anything at this time and they would be in touch if and when they needed assistance.''",Cause_General

"In 2004, the company quietly changed the measurement it used to calculate long-term incentive pay for executives, upsetting investors when they learned of it later.",Distant_Historical
"Previously, the performance measure was based on a peer-group comparison, but the new measure involved only the company's growth in earnings per share.",Distant_Historical
It was more easily reached because it was based solely on Home Depot's performance not that of other companies.,Distant_Evaluation

Many shareholders also favored a proposal urging the Home Depot board to allow its investors to vote on an advisory basis to approve the company's compensation; 40 percent voted for the measure.,Distant_Historical
Shareholders also supported a measure that would have required the board to accept resignations from directors who failed to receive support from a majority of votes cast.,Distant_Historical
"After the meeting, Home Depot said it would require such a vote from shareholders for the election of its directors.",Distant_Historical

Mr. Hill personally experienced Mr. Nardelli's disdain toward his shareholders.,Distant_Historical

"The change in Mr. Padilla's status, from enemy combatant to criminal defendant, was abrupt.",Distant_Evaluation
"It came late in 2005 as the Supreme Court was weighing whether to take up the legality of his military detention and the Bush administration, by filing criminal charges, pre-empted its review.",Distant_Historical
"In a way, Mr. Padilla's prosecution was a legal maneuver that kept the issue of his detention without charges out of the Supreme Court.",Distant_Evaluation
"After apprehending him at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in May 2002, the Bush administration made a choice: to detain Mr. Padilla militarily, in order to thwart further plotting, rather than to follow him in order to gather evidence that might serve a criminal prosecution.",Distant_Historical
"Now that Mr. Padilla has ended up a criminal defendant after all, the prosecution's case does not fully reflect the Bush administration's view of who he is or what he did.",Distant_Evaluation
"Senior government officials have said publicly that Mr. Padilla provided self-incriminating information during interrogations, admitting, they said, to undergoing basic terrorist training, to accepting an assignment to blow up apartment buildings in the United States, and to attending a farewell dinner with Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the suspected master planner of the Sept. 11 attacks, before he flew to Chicago in 2002.",Cause_General
"But any confessions by Mr. Padilla while he was detained without charges and denied access to counsel -- whether or not he was mistreated, as his lawyers claim -- would not be admissible in court.",Cause_General
"And it is unlikely that information obtained during the harsh questioning of Al Qaeda detainees would be admissible, either -- and, further, the government is disinclined to expose sensitive intelligence or invite further scrutiny of secret jails overseas.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Probably as a consequence, the current criminal case zeroes in on what the government sees as an earlier stage of Mr. Padilla's involvement with terrorism.",Main

"In one phone call, the two men talked about a dream.",Distant_Historical
"It appeared to be the dream that Mr. Padilla, according to his relatives, cites as having played a crucial role in inspiring him to convert to Islam: the vision of a man in a turban, surrounded by the swirling dust of a desert.",Distant_Evaluation

"One morning in 1952, when Dom was 16, his father sat him down at the breakfast table of their Jericho, Long Island, home and, already drunk on red wine, as was his custom, began to tell an extraordinary story.",Main
"According to Dom, his father said that Dr. Pendola was not the first man he had murdered.",Main
"The father, a strapping man of 230 pounds, said that he was a longtime ''made man'' in the Sicilian Mafia, and that, through beatings, knifings and shootings, he had served as an enforcer for Salvatore D'Aquila, an Al Capone associate and the capo di tutti capi of the New York Mafia.",Main
"So, Dom Caruso recounted, when Cheech Caruso found himself facing the electric chair, he was not abandoned.",Main

SQUARE FEET: VENTURES,NA
MUTUAL fund managers are unfairly blamed for poor performance of their funds.,Main
The track record of the average manager doesn't lag that of a simple buy-and-hold strategy because the manager is an awful stock picker.,Main
"Instead, the underperformance results from unprofitable transactions that are forced by the buy-and-sell decisions of shareholders.",Main
This defense of the average fund manager comes from a new study called ''Does Motivation Matter When Assessing Trade Performance?,Cause_Specific
An Analysis of Mutual Funds.'',Cause_Specific
"The authors of the study, which has been circulating as an academic working paper, are three finance professors: Gordon J. Alexander of the University of Minnesota and Scott Gibson and Gjergji Cici, both at the Mason Business School of the College of William and Mary.",Cause_General
A version is at papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=641743.,Cause_General
The professors' research builds on fund managers' motivations to buy or sell a stock.,Cause_General
"The most obvious, of course, is that they believe that the stock they're buying will climb and that the stock they're selling will fall.",Distant_Evaluation
But only some trades purely reflect such convictions.,Distant_Evaluation
"When investors are pouring money into the fund or selling in droves, managers have to buy or sell stocks that they would not have traded otherwise.",Distant_Evaluation
"The study used a new method for segregating fund trades according to these different motivations, allowing the professors to measure managers' pure stock-picking abilities as well as the effects of fund inflows and outflows on fund performance.",Cause_General
"The key to the approach was measuring how much money was being invested in a fund, or withdrawn from it, at the time of each transaction.",Cause_General
"Consider a large purchase that a fund manager made during a period when investors were, on balance, withdrawing a lot of money from the fund.",Distant_Evaluation
"The professors assumed that because the manager didn't have to buy the stock in order to invest a large inflow of cash, he must have believed that it would be an above-average performer -- a ''valuation-motivated buy,'' in the professors' parlance.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Similarly, a ''valuation-motivated sell'' would be a big sale that occurred when there was a large net inflow of cash into a fund.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"The professors built two hypothetical portfolios, one for the valuation-motivated buys and the other for the valuation-motivated sells.",Distant_Evaluation
The portfolios changed composition every quarter.,Distant_Evaluation
"From January 1980 through December 2003, the professors found, the first portfolio performed 2.8 percentage points a year better than the stock market as a whole, on average, while the second trailed the market by an average of 0.7 percentage point a year.",Distant_Evaluation
"The study says this means that ''when fund managers make purely valuation-motivated trades, they beat the market by a substantial margin.''",Cause_General
Then there are the trades that are intended primarily to meet redemption requests or to put new cash to work in the market.,Distant_Evaluation
"The professors assume that ''liquidity-motivated buys'' are those that occur when there is a large inflow of new cash, while ''liquidity-motivated sells'' occur amid a large number of redemption requests.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
They acknowledge that some of these trades may be motivated by considerations other than liquidity.,Distant_Evaluation
"But, they say, the average trade in their liquidity-motivated categories is less likely than that of the valuation-motivated groups to be a pure reflection of managers' beliefs about a stock's potential.",Distant_Evaluation
"The professors built two portfolios of stocks in these liquidity-motivated categories, one for the buys and one for the sells.",Distant_Evaluation
"The relative performance of the two liquidity portfolios was nearly opposite that of the valuation-motivated versions, with the buys now lagging the market and the sells outperforming it.",Distant_Evaluation
"In fact, the liquidity-motivated sells outperformed the buys by two percentage points a year, on average.",Distant_Evaluation
"In other words, the transactions that managers must make to meet liquidity needs eliminate much of the profit from trades made for valuation reasons.",Cause_General
"Transaction costs, which were not included in the calculations, coupled with management fees, eliminate the rest of that profit for the average fund.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
The professors interpret their findings to mean that mutual fund investors pay a high price for the chance to invest or withdraw money at any time.,Cause_General
"And the cost is borne by all investors, whether or not they take advantage of the opportunity.",Cause_General
The investment implication is clear: don't pay for liquidity unless you need daily access to your money.,Distant_Evaluation
Are closed-end funds the preferred alternative for long-term investors?,Distant_Evaluation
It might appear that way.,Distant_Evaluation
"After all, the amount of assets under management at closed-end funds doesn't change when investors buy or sell shares, because the number of shares outstanding is fixed.",Cause_General
This means the managers of closed-end funds are immune from rapid inflows and outflows of cash.,Distant_Evaluation
But Professor Gibson said in an interview that he did not think closed-end funds were the way to go.,Distant_Evaluation
"Because the funds' assets under management don't change even when performance is awful, the closed-end fund industry ''helps entrench poor-performing managers,'' he said.",Distant_Evaluation
"And because these funds won't receive new money even when performance is spectacular, he said, they tend to ''turn away the best managers who want to grow asset-based fees.''",Distant_Evaluation
"Because of those considerations, Professor Gibson says he instead favors open-end mutual funds that significantly restrict short-term trades.",Distant_Evaluation
"Such funds, he says, are more likely than closed-end funds to attract better managers and offer a powerful incentive for them to beat the market.",Distant_Evaluation
"And because of the restrictions on short-term trades, long-term investors don't subsidize the liquidity needs of the short-term traders.",Distant_Evaluation
"Professor Gibson says he particularly likes funds that charge redemption fees on short-term trades, especially when the fees go back into the fund.",Distant_Evaluation
"It's easy to see why short-term traders don't like these fees, he said, but ''if you're a long-term investor, they are your best friend.''",Distant_Evaluation

What propelled stock prices higher this time?,Distant_Evaluation
"For starters, data released late in the year ''put to rest all the extraneous worries about the economy,'' said James Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston.",Distant_Evaluation

He's not kidding.,Distant_Evaluation
"In the fourth quarter, investors, whom many analysts thought would embrace relatively conservative assets like blue-chip domestic stocks, went back to their speculative ways.",Distant_Evaluation
AND they were rewarded handsomely for their risk taking.,Distant_Evaluation
"Within the fixed-income world, for example, the average emerging-market bond fund rose 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 11.1 percent for the year.",Cause_General

The picture was much the same in the equity markets.,Cause_General
"The average diversified emerging-market stock fund, for example, soared 17.4 percent in the quarter and finished the year up 32.6 percent, according to Morningstar.",Cause_General
"The best-performing fund category was Latin American stock portfolios, which posted gains of 21.5 percent for the quarter and 45.2 percent for 2006.",Cause_General
"On the domestic front, many of the same sectors that have been leading the markets in recent years dominated again in 2006.",Cause_General
"Precious-metals funds, for instance, rallied 32.2 percent for the year and are now up 33.7 percent, annualized, over the last five years.",Cause_General
"Real estate and utilities portfolios also soared, posting average gains last year of 34 percent and 25.5 percent, respectively.",Cause_General
"And thanks in part to the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions, financial sector funds rose 16.4 percent, on average.",Cause_General
"Despite predictions that this would be the year when large-cap domestic stock funds returned to dominance, small-cap stock funds again led the domestic markets among general domestic stock funds.",Cause_General
"According to Morningstar, the average small-cap growth fund advanced 11.1 percent last year, versus 7.3 percent for the average large-cap growth portfolio.",Cause_General
"And while large-cap value funds outperformed their small-cap counterparts for the full year, they trailed small-cap value funds in the fourth quarter.",Cause_General
"''This appetite for risk has me a little worried,'' Mr. Swanson said.",Distant_Evaluation
"He asserted that investors aren't simply expecting a so-called soft landing in the economy -- in other words, the avoidance of a recession.",Distant_Evaluation
"''The market is bracing for the plane to circle and take off again -- and I think that's too optimistic,'' he said.",Distant_Evaluation
"Another reason that speculative investments are doing so well is that despite 17 interest-rate increases since June 2004, ample liquidity continues to slosh around the global financial markets.",Distant_Evaluation
"''Right now, there's still too much money chasing too few financial assets,'' said Stuart A. Schweitzer, global markets strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management.",Distant_Evaluation

"''What we do is fairly straightforward,'' said Frederick W. Green, president of the Merger Fund.",Distant_Evaluation
''We're the sleep-well-at-night fund.'',Distant_Evaluation
"The gains come from buying shares in a company that is being acquired, but for less than the acquirer plans to pay, then cashing out when the deal is done.",Cause_General
"Because, as Mr. Green says, 95 percent of the mergers are completed, generally within a matter of months, it's a pretty safe bet that buyers will earn the difference, or spread, between the two prices.",Distant_Evaluation
"The favorable odds go a long way toward explaining why merger or risk arbitrage, as the strategy is known, produces returns that tend to be lower, on average, than those of other stock investments.",Distant_Evaluation
"Investors trying to buy the shares after a merger announcement can't expect to get the stock for much less than the acquirer's offer, because the current shareholders can reasonably count on getting that price shortly.",Distant_Evaluation
"How much less depends on a number of factors for both buyer and seller -- for example, what their money could reliably earn in another investment, like three-month Treasury bills, or the value attached to the 1-in-20 possibility that the deal will fall through (say, over regulatory problems).",Distant_Evaluation
"When mergers are plentiful, as they are now, fund managers can pick their targets more carefully than usual.",Distant_Evaluation
"And with interest rates having edged higher, the spreads have widened between the post-announcement market price and the offer price.",Distant_Evaluation
"At times, some merger funds will short the stock of the acquirer as well as buy shares in the target company.",Cause_General
"The tactic is similar to that used by hedge funds engaged in arbitrage, though without black-box secrecy or the risk of leveraging.",Cause_General
"The price of the acquirer's shares tends to slip after the offer is made, so shorting those shares is a way to improve returns.",Cause_General
"The five-year-old AXA Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions fund, the second-largest fund with $304 million in assets, adds a much riskier arbitrage strategy to the mix.",Cause_General

"LONDON, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- Former British prime minister Tony Blair said Saturday the upcoming conferences by the big-two political parties will be a watershed moment in British politics.",Main
"The big annual gatherings will expose in sharp relief the changing state of Conservatives and Labour, Britain's current ruling and official opposition parties, said Blair.",Main
"As Labour delegates prepare to head to Liverpool next weekend for their conference, followed a week later by the Conservative conference in Birmingham, Blair said: ""They will provide evidence of the driving spirit inhabiting each main party, of the direction of the soul.""",Main
"Writing in the Times, Blair, who swept to power in 1997 after one of the biggest landslide victories in British history, said he was not advocating a new party, organising one, or wanting to vote for one.",Main
"""In the British system such an endeavour may be impossible.",Main
"But the serious figures in both main parties need to demand of their leadership: enough, change course, you do not have indefinite licence to go further towards the extremes or unlimited time to return to reason.,"" he wrote.",Main
"""The pull of the tribe is strong, and I sympathise deeply with the struggle many in both parties feel between a desire for party unity and a knowledge of what is right for the country.",Main
"But we do know what is right -- and it is not the present path of British politics.,"" he added.",Main
"The Conservatives, said Blair, are at risk of morphing into a narrow nationalist party, modelled on the Trump example, whose leader are either incapable of stopping the metamorphosis or are playing along with it.",Main
"""This is the party that took us into the European Union, fought the 1979, 1983 and 1987 elections as pro-Europeans, was critical to founding the single market and championed enlargement of the Union to eastern Europe to consolidate the western alliance,"" he said, adding: ""Now it demonises the rules of the single market as destructive of our national sovereignty and insists we leave to avoid the payments we make, along with all the other wealthier European nations, to the enlargement countries to help their development.""",Main
"Blair said contrary to myth, the EU will compromise, but he added that Europe will never agree to access to its single market without adhering to its rules, adding: ""Never.",Main
"Because that would destroy the basis of the market.""",Main
"""A ""blind Brexit"", where we only have a vague idea of the future relationship before we leave, should be unacceptable to Europe and should be unthinkable for Britain,"" he added.",Main
"Criticising prime minister Theresa May' so-called Chequers Brexit blueprint, Blair said ""It has no public support.",Main
"It neither properly protects British business nor does it honor what the Brexiteers regard as the mandate of June 2016.""",Main
Pro-European Union Blair suggested putting May's Chequers plan to the British parliament and allowing a new public vote if politicians reject it.,Main

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- Massive protests led by Brazilian women of different political affiliations shook Brazil on Saturday, as hundreds of thousands people gathered to reject the leading presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro.",Main
"The large-scale protests took place in at least 62 major cities, gathering women and men of different ages, ethnic groups, sexual orientations, social classes and political parties, campaigning for voters to choose any of 13 presidential candidates - except Bolsonaro.",Main
"The largest event took place in Sao Paulo, where around 500,000 people participated.",Cause_General
Hundreds of thousands people also gathered in Rio de Janeiro and Recife.,Cause_General
"In addition, protests were held in several foreign countries such as Argentina, France, Germany, Chile and Spain.",Cause_General
"The protests were first organized via social media under the hashtag #EleNao (NotHim) by a Facebook group named 'Women against Bolsonaro', founded in August.",Cause_General
The protests quickly gathered millions of members - now over 3.8 million.,Cause_General
"Bolsonaro's ideas for public security, including drastically reducing gun control and shielding police officers from being prosecuted for the murder of innocents, were opposed by a group called Antifascist Policemen, said Janaina Matos, a police officer who believes in new public policies to fight crime.",Distant_Anecdotal
"Today, the greatest enemy of indigenous people in Brazil is Bolsonaro, said Papion Santos, an indigenous activist.",Distant_Anecdotal
"The candidate's distaste for indigenous population is well-known, and he stated during the campaign that he would stop the demarcation of indigenous lands completely and his government would not surrender one centimeter to indigenous people in Brazil.",Distant_Evaluation
"Defending indigenous lands is defending the planet, Santos told Xinhua, hoping Brazil's new president will listen to the demands of indigenous people and other vulnerable groups.",Distant_Anecdotal
"Bolsonaro, who has some 25 to 30 percent of voting intentions according to the latest polls, is widely considered to be sexist, racist, homophobic and even fascist.",Distant_Evaluation
"He became widely popular in recent years, claiming to be an honest politician concerned about public security and traditional values.",Cause_General
That stance has helped him with right-wing voters; he is popular among the rich and has a strong advantage in the southeast and south regions.,Distant_Evaluation
"However, repeated statements against gender equality and open hostility toward minorities in general increased his rejection rate significantly in recent months.",Distant_Evaluation
"According to the latest Datafolha poll, 52 percent of Brazilian women and 54 percent of black citizens would not vote for Bolsonaro under any circumstances.",Cause_General
"In the poorer northeastern region, Bolsonaro's rejection hits 61 percent.",Cause_General
"A week before the election, massive protests against the candidate are likely to dominate the news in the next few days.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
Bolsonaro left the hospital earlier on Saturday - he was stabbed by an apparent lone wolf on Sept. 6 - and will certainly be questioned by rivals and reporters over his difficulties in dealing with half of the electorate.,Distant_Evaluation
"In a TV interview aired on Friday, he minimized the importance of the groups that oppose him, although critics say rejecting a large bloc of voters may be unwise.",Distant_Evaluation

"LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday night vowed to fight any challenge to her leadership after a day of high drama at Westminster.",Main
"First her chief Brexit minister David Davis resigned from her cabinet, followed hours later by the resignation of one of her top ministers, the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.",Main
It prompted May to carry out a mini-reshuffle of her top team in the cabinet.,Main_Consequence
RESIGNATIONS OVER SOFT BREXIT,Cause_Specific
"The two resigned over May's proposals for a soft Brexit, which Davis said did not deliver what people voted for in the 2016 national referendum when the majority of people in Britain opted to leave the European Union (EU).",Cause_Specific
"Johnson, in his resignation letter to 10 Downing Street, told May that Brexit should be about opportunity and hope, adding ""that dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"".",Distant_Evaluation
"Reminding May what he said at her awayday meeting last week, Johnson said: ""I said then, the government now has a song to sing.",Distant_Evaluation
The trouble is that I have practiced the words over the weekend and find that they stick in the throat.,Distant_Evaluation
We must have collective responsibility.,Distant_Evaluation
"Since I cannot in all conscience champion these proposals, I have sadly concluded that I must go.""",Distant_Evaluation
"Addressing MPs in a rowdy House of Commons chamber, May disputed what Johnson had said and insisted that her proposals were in keeping with what the British electorate had voted for, saying she rejected the views of the deal by both resigning ministers.",Distant_Evaluation
"May said Brexit negotiations with the EU have settled virtually all of the withdrawal agreement, but the two models on offer from Brussels were not acceptable.",Distant_Evaluation
"She told MPs: ""A responsible government must prepare for a range of potential outcomes, including the possibility of no deal, and given the short period remaining before the conclusion of negotiations, the Cabinet agreed on Friday that these preparations should be stepped up.""",Distant_Evaluation
"""It is the Brexit that will deliver on the democratic decision of the British people, and it is the right Brexit deal for Britain,"" she said.",Distant_Evaluation
MIXED REACTIONS,Distant_Evaluation
"Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, told May that if her government could not get its act together it should make way for those who can.",Distant_Evaluation
"Corbyn told MPs: ""It is two years since the referendum and 16 months since article 50 was triggered, and it was only this weekend that the members of the cabinet managed to agree a negotiating position among themselves -- and that illusion lasted 48 hours.""",Distant_Evaluation
"""We have a crisis in the government: two Secretaries of State have resigned, and we are still no clearer about what our future relationship with our nearest neighbors and biggest trading partners will look like,"" Corbyn said.",Distant_Evaluation
"Saying the Chequers compromise took two years to reach and just two days to unravel, Corbyn added: ""How can anyone have faith in the Prime Minister getting a good deal with 27 European Union Governments when she cannot even broker a deal within her own Cabinet?""",Distant_Evaluation
"Gina Miller, who took the British Government to court in her battle to secure a parliamentary vote on a Brexit deal, described the day's events as extraordinary.",Distant_Evaluation
"She said: ""It's open warfare within a political party that is not putting the country first or second or third.",Distant_Evaluation
"What all of us should be calling for: stop fighting and blackmailing each other; put together a plan, with details not just dogma, then put it to the EU -- get the best deal you can; then put it to the people to validate.""",Distant_Evaluation
"Miller said the question should then be to leave or not to leave the EU, adding.",Distant_Evaluation
"""This is hugely damaging to our national interest and global reputation.""",Distant_Evaluation
"David Blake, professor of finance at the Cass Business School in London said: ""When two cabinet ministers resign on the same day, we should sit up and ask whether a sense of reality is beginning to return to the 'Alice in Wonderland' world that Brexit has become.""",Distant_Evaluation
"Blake added: ""There are only two coherent cases: being fully in the EU or fully leaving.",Distant_Evaluation
"There is no coherent half-way house.""",Distant_Evaluation
Later this week the British government will publish full details of the Brexit deal it wants with Brussels.,Cause_General
It will then become clear how EU negotiators react to her plans.,Distant_Evaluation
NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE,Distant_Expectations_Consequences
Downing Street insisted that May would fight to keep her job if Conservative MPs triggered a no-confidence vote in her.,Cause_General
"Conservative rules mean that 15 percent of the party's MPs would have to back a call for a confidence vote, meaning 48 politicians would have to write to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee, to trigger the process.",Cause_General
"Political commentators were posing the question Monday night whether two of her biggest ministers quitting would badly wound May's government, and whether the changes so close to negotiations with Brussels reaching a critical stage, could wreck Brexit altogether.",Cause_General
Professor Jon Tonge from the University of Liverpool told Xinhua that the resignations of Davis and Johnson could actually strengthen May's weak hand towards a slightly softer Brexit.,Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Tonge, an expert in British and Irish politics, said a snap general election was possible, but he thought it unlikely following the result of the election May called in 2017 which led to her losing her narrow majority in the House of Commons.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"He added that a confidence vote was very likely, predicting that May would probably win such a challenge among her Conservative MPs.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
