"MANY investors have been heeding market strategists' advice to reduce portfolio risk by putting more money into stable, high-quality, dividend-paying stocks.",Distant_Evaluation
"But instead of plowing this money into large-capitalization companies based in the United States, investors have redirected much of it into shares of blue-chip foreign companies based largely in Western Europe and Japan.",Main
"Indeed, foreign large-cap blend funds -- which primarily invest in blue-chip growth and value stocks in developed markets -- were the most popular category of funds through the first 11 months of 2006, according to the Financial Research Corporation in Boston.",Cause_Specific
Foreign large-blend funds attracted $43.8 billion of net new money during this stretch.,Cause_General
"By comparison, highflying diversified emerging-market stock funds attracted $6.6 billion and domestic large-blend funds drew $4 billion, according to Financial Research.",Cause_General
"But does investing in blue chips abroad achieve the same results for a portfolio as investing in big, high-quality domestic stocks?",Distant_Evaluation
"The answer is still no, given the currency risks that you inevitably take on when investing abroad.",Distant_Evaluation
"Yet a growing number of people argue that foreign and domestic stocks are becoming more alike, given the increased correlation among the world's markets.",Distant_Evaluation
"Since 1970, for example, the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE index, for European, Australian and Far Eastern stocks, has returned 11.6 percent a year, on average.",Cause_General
That is nearly identical to the annualized gain of 11.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of domestic blue chips.,Cause_General
"But keep in mind that those slightly higher gains came with slightly higher risk, as foreign stocks on their own are still more volatile than domestic equities.",Distant_Evaluation
"Sometimes, a modest dose of a risky asset can make an entire portfolio less volatile.",Distant_Evaluation
"From 1970 to 2005, a 100 percent stock portfolio invested in the S.& P. 500 would have earned 11.1 percent, annualized, according to S.& P. And that is with a so-called standard deviation -- a popular measure of volatility -- of 16.8.",Cause_General
"But by moving 25 percent of that money from the S.& P. 500 to the EAFE index, the portfolio would have earned 11.4 percent a year, on average, with a slightly lower standard deviation of 16.4.",Cause_General
"Add too much, however, and more volatility enters the mix.",Cause_General
"In this case, had 75 percent of the equity stake been invested in the EAFE index and 25 percent in the S.& P. 500, the portfolio would have earned the same 11.4 percent, annualized, from 1970 to 2005.",Cause_General
But the portfolio's volatility would have shot up to 19.1.,Cause_General
"This shows that while the global markets may be moving more in sync, ''the world markets aren't completely integrated yet,'' said James D. Peterson, vice president of the Schwab Center for Investment Research in San Francisco.",Distant_Evaluation
Consider the recent performance of foreign and domestic blue chips.,Cause_General
"Over the last five years, the average foreign large-blend fund returned 13.8 percent a year, on average, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund tracker, as many foreign economies have grown faster than that of the United States and as the dollar has weakened of late.",Cause_General
"By comparison, domestic large-cap blend funds advanced only 6.3 percent a year, on average, during this stretch.",Cause_General
"And last year, foreign blue-chip funds soared 25.1 percent, beating the returns of domestic blue-chip funds by more than 10 percentage points.",Cause_General
"Arguably, much of the investor interest in foreign blue chips can be attributed to their outperformance, not to their similarities to their domestic counterparts.",Cause_Specific
"''A lot of people just want to be exposed to foreign because it's been doing so well,'' said Ronald W. Rogé, a financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y. ''It's performance chasing.''",Distant_Anecdotal
"To be sure, the correlation between the S.& P. 500 and the EAFE index has been 0.8 over the last three years, according to Morningstar.",Cause_General
"On paper, that is fairly high, because a correlation of 1.0 implies that two assets are moving in perfect tandem.",Cause_General
"But consider that over this same stretch, the correlation between the S.& P. 500 and the Russell 2000 index of small domestic stocks was actually greater, 0.83, according to Morningstar.",Cause_General
Yet investors take it on faith that large-cap and small-cap stocks are entirely different asset classes.,Distant_Evaluation
There are several reasons for continuing to treat foreign and domestic blue-chip stocks separately.,Distant_Evaluation
"''A big reason is the issue of currency,'' Mr. Peterson said.",Distant_Evaluation
"Investors who put money to work in a foreign market should consider that market's volatility, as well as that of the currency in which its stocks trade.",Distant_Evaluation
"In 2006, the EAFE index rose 13.8 percent when measured in local currencies, according to MSCI.",Cause_General
"But for Americans to make an investment abroad, money must first be converted from dollars to those local currencies to buy the securities.",Cause_General
"And when it comes time to sell, the money has to be reconverted back into dollars.",Cause_General
"In dollar terms, the EAFE index actually returned much more last year: 23.5 percent.",Cause_General
That is because the dollar lost value against the euro.,Cause_General
A weakening dollar is a tailwind for Americans investing abroad because each share of their foreign stock becomes worth that much more in dollars.,Distant_Evaluation
SO isn't this good news for domestic investors?,Distant_Evaluation
It certainly was last year.,Distant_Evaluation
"But what happens if the dollar turns around this year and appreciates, as it did in 2005?",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"In that case, investors could see a big chunk of their foreign stock market gains evaporate -- even if the global stock markets are highly correlated -- simply because the dollar gained value.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"This is one reason that investors should always assess several factors in the risk and return of a particular stock, said Francis M. Kinniry Jr., a principal in the investment counseling and research department at the Vanguard Group.",Distant_Evaluation
"These include its industry, its value or growth orientation, its market cap and the region where it operates.",Distant_Evaluation
"''While issues of style and cap size are always important, in many cases they would be secondary to geographic regions,'' Mr. Kinniry said, because stocks will always be affected by their regional economies and local currencies.",Distant_Evaluation
"In other words, while geography may not be as important a subject as it used to be for investors, it is still one to be studied.",Distant_Evaluation

"THE dollar fell against many currencies in 2006, and many Wall Street analysts are predicting more of the same this year.",Main
"That needn't worry investors, who could profit from a continued decline in many ways.",Distant_Evaluation
But some strategists caution that it may be wiser to try to benefit indirectly from a weaker dollar -- by holding stocks or stock funds focused on certain industries and countries -- than by betting directly on foreign currencies.,Distant_Evaluation
"''You've got to know your limitations,'' said Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's.",Distant_Evaluation
"''Unless you make millions of dollars on Wall Street, you probably shouldn't be speculating in currencies.''",Distant_Evaluation
"In 2006, the dollar fell 10.2 percent against the euro and 12 percent against the British pound, although it rose 1.1 percent against the Japanese yen.",Cause_General
"Mr. Stovall said the best move for most individual investors would be to stock up on the shares of American multinational corporations that earn a lot of their revenues abroad, as well as on foreign stocks.",Distant_Evaluation
"''We feel that many foreign economies are not as far along in their economic cycle, and they have good growth potential now,'' he said.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"He recommended that individual investors allocate 40 percent of their total portfolios to domestic stocks, 20 percent to foreign stocks, 25 percent to domestic bonds and 15 percent to cash instruments like money market accounts and certificates of deposit.",Distant_Evaluation

"On average, the companies in this index earn 41 percent of their revenue in foreign countries.",Cause_General

But averages can hide wide variances.,Distant_Evaluation
Some industries represented in the S.& P. 500 draw much more of their revenue abroad than others.,Cause_General
"Companies in the energy and technology sectors, for example, generate well over half of their sales outside the United States, while the utilities and telecommunications companies in the index produce a vast majority of their revenue at home.",Cause_General

"Stuart A. Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, has recommended European stocks for a few years.",Distant_Evaluation
"He said that individual investors should now focus on developed markets -- and that if they have made a lot of money in emerging markets funds in recent years, they may want to consider rebalancing their portfolios.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"''You have to be a little bit concerned that emerging-markets debt and equity may have gotten a bit ahead of themselves,'' he said.",Distant_Evaluation
Mr. Schweitzer said that any further appreciation of the euro could be modest this year.,Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Still, he added, European stocks were appealing investments for a host of other reasons.",Distant_Evaluation
"He pointed out that the average dividend yield in the S.& P. 500 index was now 1.8 percent, compared with 3.2 percent for the MSCI United Kingdom index and 2.5 percent for the MSCI Europe index, excluding Britain.",Cause_General
"For Americans investing in Britain or on the continent, a further slide by the dollar against the pound or the euro could bolster those dividend advantages.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"''Meanwhile, European companies are cutting costs and restructuring, and that's starting to show up in their earnings growth,'' Mr. Schweitzer said.",Distant_Evaluation
"Earnings per share for European stocks, he said, grew almost twice as fast in the first five years of this decade as they did during the last five years of the 1990s.",Cause_General
"On the fixed-income side of their portfolios, some investors may be tempted to profit directly from a falling dollar by buying foreign bonds or CDs.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"But Martin J. Mauro, the fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, said he didn't think the time was ripe for investing in foreign bonds.",Distant_Evaluation
"Interest rates are likely to fall in the United States this year but rise in many other countries, Mr. Mauro said.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates, so both European and Asian bonds would generally be unattractive for American investors, he said.",Distant_Evaluation
Many economists predict that the dollar will fall further against the Japanese yen than it will against the euro -- largely because the dollar rose slightly against the yen in 2006.,Main
S.& P. forecasts a dollar decline of 6.8 percent against the yen this year; Merrill Lynch sees a decline of 10 percent.,Main
But Mr. Mauro said American investors would be giving up too much yield if they bought Japanese bonds or CDs.,Distant_Evaluation
"Short-term interest rates are less than 1 percent in Japan, versus 5 percent in the United States.",Cause_General
And Mr. Mauro said he expected the dollar to fall by only an additional 1 percent or so against the euro -- which he said wouldn't be quite enough to make up for the yield that Americans would sacrifice by buying European bonds or CDs.,Main
"One-year government bills in the United States currently pay around 5 percent, versus 3.9 percent in Germany.",Cause_General
"For now, he recommends high-quality domestic bonds.",Distant_Evaluation
"He said typical individual investors should put at most 5 percent of their bond portfolios into high-yield bonds, and none into emerging-market debt.",Distant_Evaluation
"Although short-term rates are relatively high, he recommends intermediate maturities -- 5 to 15 years -- because he expects domestic interest rates to be lower next year.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"''If we're right, and the economy weakens and the Fed cuts rates, then what investors will earn on short-term rates will be a lot less next year,'' he said.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences

"FINALLY, if investors are really worried about the dollar, Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, advises them to put about 5 percent of their portfolios into gold.",Distant_Evaluation
He recommends buying the metal through an exchange-traded fund like StreetTracks Gold Shares or the iShares Comex Gold Trust -- both of which are backed by bars of gold in a vault.,Distant_Evaluation
"He predicted that gold could rise as much as 20 percent in 2007, to around $750 an ounce.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences

"''Activist shareholders are giving more confidence to those who felt in the past that they had no say and remind managers of their duties to account for shareholders' interest,'' said David Brooks, head of mergers at the advisory firm Grant Thornton in London.",Distant_Evaluation
The recent explosion of private equity wealth and the rising appetite for takeovers are adding to the pressure on management to listen to shareholders.,Cause_General
Analysts say shareholder activism is also focusing on a growing distrust of senior management that can be traced back to corporate scandals like those at Enron and Parmalat.,Cause_General
"There is a general tendency that ''if there is a problem with the company, shareholders will say, 'Let's do something about it ourselves and don't trust the directors to do so,' '' said Roger Lawson, communications director for the UK Shareholders' Association.",Distant_Evaluation

We're talking about real money here.,Cause_General
"Today, Alpha magazine will release another big list, and this one offers a chance to answer another, arguably more important, question: Are these billionaire hedge fund managers really worth it?",Main
The reason hedge funds are a license to print money is their fee structure.,Cause_Specific
"A typical fund charges a 2 percent management fee, which means that it keeps 2 cents of every dollar that it manages, regardless of performance.",Cause_Specific
"Mutual funds, on average, charge about 1 percent.",Cause_General
"On top of the management fee, hedge funds also take a big cut -- usually at least 20 percent -- of any profits that exceed a predetermined benchmark.",Cause_Specific
"So in a good year, a fund's managers bring in stunning amounts of money, and in a bad year, they still do very well.",Distant_Evaluation
"Some quick math shows why: 2 percent of a $5 billion portfolio, which was roughly the cutoff for making Alpha's list of the 100 largest funds, equals $100 million.",Cause_General
A fund's managers get to take that fee every single year.,Cause_General
Last year was actually a pretty tough year for the industry.,Distant_Evaluation
Because hedge funds tend to make a lot of countercyclical bets -- thus the name -- they can often turn a profit even when the stock market falls.,Distant_Evaluation
"When it's rising broadly, though, many struggle to keep up.",Distant_Evaluation
"Last year, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 14 percent, while the average hedge fund returned less than 13 percent, after investment fees, according to Hedge Fund Research in Chicago.",Distant_Historical
But the men -- and they are all men -- who appear on Alpha's list of top earners don't manage average hedge funds.,Cause_General
"They manage the biggest funds in the world, the ones that are winning the Darwinian competition for capital, and many of them aren't having any trouble beating the market.",Cause_Specific
"One of the funds at Mr. Simons's firm, Renaissance Technologies, delivered a net return of 21 percent last year.",Distant_Historical
The other returned 44 percent after fees.,Distant_Historical

"''The best performance is coming from the largest funds,'' said Christy Wood, who oversees equities investments for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which, like a lot of pension funds, is moving more money into hedge funds.",Distant_Anecdotal
But there is an irony to this influx of money.,Distant_Evaluation
It all but guarantees that hedge fund pay over the next few years won't be as closely tied to performance as it has been.,Distant_Expectations_Consequences
The hundreds of millions of dollars that have flowed into hedge funds have made it all the harder for fund managers to find truly undervalued investments.,Distant_Evaluation
The world is awash in capital.,Distant_Evaluation
"All that capital, of course, also translates into ever-greater management fees, regardless of a fund's performance.",Cause_General
"The flagship hedge fund at Goldman Sachs lost 6 percent last year, but it still brought in a nice stream of fees.",Distant_Historical
"Bridgewater Associates, which is based in Greenwich, has earned a net return of less than 4 percent in each of the last two years.",Distant_Historical

"''And when we have a good year, we have a great year.''",Distant_Anecdotal
"Goldman and Bridgewater may well bounce back, but the combination of extraordinary pay and ordinary performance is going to occur more and more in the coming years.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences

"Too bad Alan Greenspan, who does not speak Chinese, can't apply.",Distant_Evaluation
"One of the biggest challenges for Chinese leaders these days lies in when and how to rein in the country's soaring stock market and, just as important, whom to pick as the next governor of the central bank.",Main
The challenges are closely intertwined.,Distant_Evaluation
"Like Mr. Greenspan nearly a decade ago, Zhou Xiaochuan, the current governor of the People's Bank of China, faces the knotty question of what to do about a speculative mania that has drawn millions of people with limited investing experience into betting their savings on the stock market.",Cause_General
"Mr. Greenspan, now 81, struggled to contain the tech stock boom, issuing his famous ''irrational exuberance'' warning in December 1996 only to watch the American market keep rising and finally collapse in early 2000.",Distant_Historical

"The central bank, securities regulators and prominent business executives have all been cautioning investors that buying stocks is not a guaranteed path to riches -- all with less apparent effect than Mr. Greenspan.",Cause_General
''Will the Shanghai market correct at some stage?,Distant_Evaluation
"Yes, that's inevitable,'' said Michael R. P. Smith, the chief executive of HSBC's extensive Asian operations.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"''Valuations are too high, I think; you can't sustain P/E multiples of 40, 50 times.''",Distant_Evaluation
"The economy is booming, but fairly low inflation, 3 percent, also makes for a conundrum similar to what Mr. Greenspan faced as Federal Reserve chairman: it is harder for Mr. Zhou to justify raising interest rates significantly.",Distant_Evaluation
"For Mr. Zhou, there is a further complication in that he faces considerable uncertainty about his personal future.",Distant_Evaluation
"Five years into his current job, he turns 60 next year, and so by Chinese standards is due for a transfer or promotion.",Cause_General

"The government has taken a few such measures this year, like investigating fund managers to make sure that they do not engage in self-dealing at the expense of their clients, and requiring this week that new brokerage customers sign forms acknowledging that they understand the risks of stocks.",Cause_General
"But stocks sailed higher on Wednesday after an announcement by the finance ministry and State Administration of Taxation that the government had no plans to raise taxes on share transactions, an approach the government has sometimes taken in the past to curb speculation.",Cause_Specific
Cash is pouring into the stock market partly because money is pouring into China in general.,Cause_General

But that does not necessarily mean faster appreciation of the yuan.,Distant_Evaluation
"Raising interest rates, a conventional cure for asset speculation, runs the risk of attracting even more foreign investment to China.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"The People's Bank of China has raised interest rates only four times in the last 13 months, while also raising eight times the percentage of assets that commercial banks must keep as reserves at the central bank.",Cause_General
"Partly because the People's Bank of China does not have nearly the same independence as the Federal Reserve and partly because Chinese economic policy makers have shunned the celebrity surrounding many of their overseas counterparts, Mr. Zhou has not attracted as much attention as Mr. Greenspan.",Distant_Evaluation
But now he is the subject of a guessing game about possible successors -- and about the extent to which career jockeying may make public officials leery of unpopular decisions.,Distant_Evaluation
"The most commonly cited potential governors are Shang Fulin, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission; Guo Shuqing, Communist Party secretary of the China Construction Bank; and Wu Xiaoling, who is the central bank's senior deputy governor but at 60 may already be deemed too old to succeed Mr. Zhou.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Mr. Zhou was president of China Construction Bank and then chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission before taking over leadership of the central bank, so Mr. Shang and Mr. Guo could each be viewed as possibly following in his footsteps.",Distant_Evaluation
"As for Mr. Zhou himself, he is cited by some experts as a contender to rise as high as deputy prime minister of China -- if he can stay popular a few more months.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
But a possible slump in the stock market could hurt Mr. Zhou's future prospects -- even if damage to the broader economy may be limited.,Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Some experts, like Jonathan Anderson, the chief Asia economist at UBS, suggest that because the rising stock market seems to have had little effect on the rate of economic growth over the last year and a half, it may not have much effect going down.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"''It's very hard indeed to see where the negative growth impact would come from,'' he said in a research report on Thursday, noting that equities form a tenth of total household and business wealth in China.",Distant_Evaluation

"''If I don't make money on the investment in my lifetime, I'll leave it to my children and grandchildren.''",Distant_Anecdotal
"The bigger worry, but much harder to calculate, lies in whether the country's banks have unintentionally or secretly lent heavily to stock market speculators who would not be able to repay their loans if the market collapsed.",Distant_Evaluation
Chinese banking regulations bar banks from issuing margin loans directly to stock market investors.,Cause_General

China’s planned scrapping of foreign ownership restrictions in the auto industry is in part a response to criticism that Chinese companies have been largely allowed to invest freely in outside markets while Beijing limits foreign firms’ access to the world’s second-largest economy.,Cause_Specific

"LONDON, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- As British Prime Minister Theresa May appointed replacements Friday for the two front-bench ministers who quit this week, a leading expert in politics predicted she only stood a 50-50 chance of winning a challenge to her leadership.",Main
Professor Philip Cowley from Queen Mary University of London said those odds of success for her reign at 10 Downing Street are not such a good position for her to be in.,Distant_Evaluation
"As political commentators and parliamentary correspondents in London eagerly waited to see if a challenge to May emerges, the prime minster was busy at Number 10 hiring two new ministers to take over from Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Works and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey who quit this week from their government roles.",Cause_General
Both said they could not support the Brexit agreement agreed this week by the majority of May's cabinet.,Distant_Evaluation
"Amber Rudd, who served as Home Secretary, essentially Britain's top interior minister, was brought back into the cabinet to succeed McVey.",Cause_General
"Raab, who only took over the Brexit hot seat in July after the first holder of the post, David Davis, resigned, was succeeded by a politician relatively known outside the so-called Westminster bubble.",Cause_General
Health Minister Stephen Barclay was appointed to what political commentator described as the government job no politician wanted.,Distant_Evaluation
"Former banker Barclay, who supported Britain leaving the European Union in the 2016 referendum, was appointed to the House of Commons in 2010, representing a constituency on Cambridgeshire.",Distant_Historical
The main attention remained focused firmly on May with reports that the number of names needed to trigger a vote of no confidence in her had reached the minimum 48 required.,Cause_General
"In what is a highly secretive procedure, an announcement of a vote will be made at some stage, and result in a vote among the more than 300 Conservative MPs.",Cause_General
Professor Cowley believes a no-confidence move could even give May a boost if she wins the vote among Conservative MPs who sit in the House of Commons.,Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"""Even if she wins by one vote it would mean she could not be challenged again for a year,"" he said.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Cowley, a political scientist, who has co-authored a new book, The British General Election of 2017, said if May lost the vote, or decided to step down if she won only by an insignificant margin, there would have to be a leadership contest to elect a new leader and prime minister, causing a delay of several weeks to the Brexit roller-coaster.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"May, he said, could be strengthened by the party's own rules which would prevent a second challenge for at least a year.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"""It would immediately mean that attack would disappear.",Distant_Evaluation
"At the moment May is facing a battle on two flanks, one in parliament and the other within her own Conservative Party.",Distant_Evaluation
"""If she won the vote of confidence by a big enough margin to carry on, and there has been talk of her winning by around 100, she would be at least able not to have to worry about another challenge from her own MPs.""",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Cowley said one problem for May could be Conservative MPs who had not wanted a challenge in the first place, but who had doubts about her leadership, deciding that this would be their one chance to seek a new party leader.",Cause_Specific

Lawmakers will start a marathon five-day debate on Tuesday on the withdrawal deal agreed between May and the European Council a week ago.,Cause_General

"So far nobody knows what will happen if May loses the vote, with leading politicians and political commentators putting forward a range of post-vote scenarios.",Cause_General
"They range from May seeking a modified deal from Britain, to her resigning as prime minister to let a new occupant of 10 Downing Street to take over the Brexit relay race, to a snap general election.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Professor Anthony Glees from the University of Buckingham told Xinhua in an exclusive interview: ""This is a political crisis which can, on Dec. 11, become a constitutional crisis if May loses, as all the experts believe she will do.",Main
"If it is not resolved properly and quickly it will explode into a crisis affecting everyone in the UK, old, young, rich, poor, employer and employee, the sick and the healthy.""",Main
"The leader of the main opposition Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer, said in a Sunday morning television interview that his party will call for a confidence vote in May's government if she loses the vote, with a snap general election a possible outcome.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"To add to May's political woes, opposition parties at Westminster are on the warpath over a government refusal to publish advice given about the Brexit withdrawal deal by the country's top legal officer, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.",Cause_General
"Cox, who wrote the advice, will make a statement on Monday in the House of Commons on the advice he has given, with only a summary of the legal advice published.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give May's minority government its slender majority, has accused the government of having something to hide by holding back on the full advice politicians have demanded.",Cause_General
Behind the row over the advice is a suspicion by some politicians that it explains the arrangements in the withdrawal deal over the fate of the post-Brexit border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.,Distant_Evaluation
A permanent solution to maintaining a frictionless border between the two parts of Ireland has yet to be agreed by Britain and the EU.,Cause_General
"The fear among some politicians is that a temporary border arrangement, which May insists would only be for a short time, could be in place indefinitely as it would need approval from the European Union to remove.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences

"Its report claimed the details have been confirmed to the newspaper by three serving cabinet ministers, including the former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who resigned recently because of his opposition to May's deal with the EU.",Cause_General
"On the last day of her visit to Argentina where she attended the G20 Summit, May said: ""The next nine days are a really important time for our country leading up to the vote on this deal.""",Distant_Evaluation
"May has insisted she will press on with promoting her withdrawal agreement, saying it is the best deal for the country and respects the decision of the 2016 referendum when Britain voted to leave the EU.",Cause_General
She returned to 10 Downing Street Sunday to prepare for what will be one of the most important and intense periods in British politics in a generation.,Distant_Evaluation
"Meanwhile Glees, who is director of the Center for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said it seems inevitable May will lose on Dec. 11, with no more than 286 of the 650 MPs backing her, and the number of supporters decreasing on a daily basis.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"May's withdrawal plan, said Glees, is a compromise which has split MPs in the House of Commons because it pleases neither side.",Distant_Evaluation
"Glees acknowledged that despite what MPs say, nobody can be sure how they will vote on Dec. 11.",Distant_Evaluation
"On the question of what will happen, Glees told Xinhua: ""We are moving now into totally uncharted waters.",Distant_Evaluation
Mrs May will probably want to try again if she loses on Dec. 11.,Distant_Expectations_Consequences
Perhaps a stock market and currency slump would focus Conservative MPs' minds on the need to support her a second time.,Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Perhaps she would dissolve Parliament and have a general election.""",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
Glees says his understanding is that May believes the British people voted to quit the EU and if she does not achieve this it will destroy the Conservative Party.,Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"In a reference to the long standing Eurosceptic wing within the Conservative party, Glees said: ""The Brexiters have, after 40 years, finally won and May has to recognize that.",Distant_Evaluation
"At the same time, as a vicar's daughter, she genuinely wants not to harm ordinary British people.""",Distant_Evaluation
"Glees said if it ends in disaster for May, and she faces a confidence vote it could lead one of her ministers taking over as prime minister.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"""Or there could be an early snap general election and a new Labour leader, perhaps with my former Brunel student John McDonnell (Labour's Shadow Chancellor) in Downing Street.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences

"TOKYO, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, winning the ruling party's leadership election Thursday, will likely to become Japan's longest-serving leader, but underwhelming support shown by rank-and-file party members may spell difficulties ahead for both party and president, political analysts said.",Main
"In the leadership race, Abe's only opponent was former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba who in the run-up to the election voiced different views to Abe on constitutional reform and economic policies and ended up mounting a far-bigger challenge to the incumbent than expected.",Cause_General
"Local political observers pointed out that while Abe has secured the top party post for a third-consecutive term, effectively ensuring his position as the nation's next prime minister owing to the ruling coalition's majorities in both chambers of parliament, Ishiba garnering far more support than expected from rank-and-file members has certainly raised some red flags looking ahead.",Distant_Evaluation
"While Abe won 329 out of ballots cast by Diet members, and 224 by rank-and-file members, Ishiba secured 73 votes from legislators but an unexpected 181 votes from ordinary members, who closely reflect public opinion.",Cause_Specific
"This, political analysts said, was to a certain extent down to increasing opposition to the prime minister's long reign amid ongoing cronyism allegations, ineffectual economic policies and the railroading through parliament of contentious legislation, including those related to security, to push forward his constitutional reform agenda.",Distant_Evaluation
"The underwhelming support in the leadership election, described by political watchers here as a ""backlash"" by the LDP's rank-and-file members, is ""most certainly"" reflected in public opinion, specialists in politics and national ideology have maintained.",Distant_Evaluation
"""People have begun to feel weary of slogan-only and deceptive politics and Abe's style of the privatized use of public power and hawkish stance toward diplomacy and East Asian international relations,"" Dr. Shin Chiba, professor with Special Appointment, who specializes in political theory, said.",Distant_Evaluation
"Abe, following his victory, was quick to reiterate his plans to forge ahead with his career goal of revising the nation's Supreme Law for the first time since World War II, having controversially and against public and constitutional experts' opinions redefined the role of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) three years ago, to allow it to take part in collective-self defense and come to the aid of an ally under attack, even if its own territory is not threatened.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Henceforth, Abe will thus seek to secure the two-thirds majority needed in both houses of parliament and a majority in a national referendum to bring about his legacy-led revisions to the constitution, which will specifically make reference to the SDF and ""purportedly"" clear up its current constitutional ambiguity.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"However, as recent polls have suggested, the Japanese public are far more concerned about the dire fiscal health of the nation, rather than the prime minister's singular goal of revising the Supreme Law for the first time since it took effect in 1947.",Distant_Evaluation
Abe's reasons for constitutional reform are both personal and political.,Distant_Evaluation
"He is a long-time devotee of constitutional reform and has used geopolitical pretexts to push forward his reforms, noted Tina Burrett, Associate Professor of Political Science at Sophia University.",Distant_Evaluation
"""The public are split on the issue of reform... for most voters, however, the economy and public services are far more important issues,"" she said.",Distant_Evaluation
"Her sentiments have been echoed by other experts on the matter, with Yu Uchiyama, a political scientist at the University of Tokyo, believing Abe's constitutional agenda is far from a straightforward one, with a public mandate on the issue possibly going awry.",Distant_Evaluation
"""Even if Abe manages to force a revision through parliament, he would face a referendum, raising the prospect of a Brexit-style political meltdown if the people vote against him,"" Uchiyama said.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"With public support for the premier and his Cabinet tepid at best amid myriad cronyism scandals and economic malaise perpetrated by a vastly unclear blueprint as to how to deal with the nation's ballooning social welfare costs related to its rapidly aging and shrinking society, security issues are currently not a public priority, political experts have attested.",Distant_Evaluation
"Christian Collet, from International Christian University's Politics and International Relations faculty maintained that the Japanese populace believe that Article 9 of Japan's pacifist charter, that states that Japanese people forever renounce war and that land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained, despite Abe's aspirations, should remain as is.",Distant_Evaluation
"""Significant segments of the public will continue to resist the efforts to revise Article 9 and there is near unanimous opposition to Japan becoming a nuclear power,"" the expert said.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"With Abe only gaining about 55 percent of all votes at the local level in the leadership election, members in the ruling camp have been quoted as saying the figures were ""shocking,"" particularly as they closely reflect public opinion.",Distant_Evaluation
"LDP party members have also said that the worse-than-expected voting numbers could suggest that victory in the upper house election slated for the summer of 2019 might not be a shoo-in for the ruling camp, with an LDP executive describing the outcome of the leadership vote as ""a revolt from the local regions.""",Distant_Evaluation
"Criticism is now swirling within the ruling party following Thursday's presidential election, reflecting rising dissent from factions within the party based on the lack of support for Abe staying at the helm from the party's own rank-and-file members, sources close to the matter said.",Distant_Evaluation
"People both support and don't support him (Abe) at the same time, said Masao Matsumoto, professor in the Social Survey Research Center at Saitama University, highlighting the political and public divide.",Distant_Evaluation
"And, Abe's sole rival in the leadership race was of the same opinion, in terms of both the ruling party and its leader and a growing lack of cohesion.",Distant_Evaluation

"So even before the floodwaters receded, Mr. Baldwin dusted off and began revising an old proposal to build a retention dam across the Pequonnock where one existed in the first half of the 20th century.",Main
"Other public officials around the state are showing similar determination, with a number of communities hit hard by the storm resurrecting old projects with renewed vigor.",Main
"And in places where flood mitigation work was done, officials are using the storm as a test to determine whether they need to reassess.",Main
"In East Haven, notorious for its coastal and river flooding, officials said that recent projects had left roads more passable than in past storms, though residents of one beach area complained that their homes were as flooded as ever.",Distant_Evaluation

"After some 40 feet of bank collapsed in last month's storm, threatening at least one home, approvals arrived within days.",Cause_General
Work began a week later.,Cause_General
One reason communities now see the need to revisit their flood plans is that population growth and intense development have changed how the landscape handles water.,Cause_Specific
"A recent analysis by the University of Connecticut's Center for Land Use Education and Research showed that from 1985 to 2002, the percentage of the state's surface that is impervious increased by 22 percent, much of it in coastal areas.",Cause_Specific
That means more runoff and more flooding -- something Westport is all too familiar with.,Distant_Evaluation
"The town completed millions of dollars in flood mitigation work in the last 10 years, after a 1992 storm inundated it and a number of coastal communities.",Cause_General
"But there was still substantial flooding last month around beaches, the Saugatuck River and the many brooks and streams that flow through town.",Cause_General
"Westport officials attribute much of the flooding to a development spurt in the years after the town's most recent study of flood areas and drainage, done in the 1970s.",Distant_Evaluation
"Within days of the recent floods, town officials requested that the Flood and Erosion Control Board authorize a new study to determine how to redirect priorities.",Main
"''It's close to 30 years,'' said the town's public works director, Stephen J. Edwards.",Distant_Evaluation

"Then, last Friday night, a deadly tornado all but cleared the small town of Greensburg off the Kansas map.",Cause_Specific
"With 80 square blocks of the small farming town destroyed, Ms. Sebelius said her fears had come true: The emergency response was too slow, she said, and there was only one reason.",Distant_Evaluation
"''As you travel around Greensburg, you'll see that city and county trucks have been destroyed,'' Ms. Sebelius, a Democrat, said Monday.",Cause_General
''The National Guard is one of our first responders.,Cause_General
"They don't have the equipment they need to come in, and it just makes it that much slower.''",Distant_Evaluation
"For nearly two days after the storm, there was an unmistakable emptiness in Greensburg, a lack of heavy machinery and an army of responders.",Main
"By Sunday afternoon, more than a day and a half after the tornado, only about half of the Guard troops who would ultimately respond were in place.",Main
"It was not until Sunday night that significant numbers of military vehicles started to arrive, many streaming in a long caravan from Wichita about 100 miles away.",Main
"Ms. Sebelius's comments about the slow response prompted a debate with the White House on Tuesday, which initially said the fault rested with her.",Distant_Evaluation
"Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, said the governor should have followed procedure by finding gaps after the storm hit and asking the federal government to fill them -- but did not.",Distant_Evaluation
"''If you don't request it, you're not going to get it,'' Mr.",Distant_Evaluation
Snow told reporters on Tuesday morning.,Distant_Evaluation
The debate was reminiscent of the Bush administration's skirmishes with Gov.,Distant_Evaluation

"But after an angry flurry of words, both sides seemed to back down a bit later Tuesday.",Cause_General
"Ms. Sibelius said she now had enough equipment and personnel to deal with the problems in Greensburg, and the White House acknowledged that the governor had requested several items that the federal government supplied, including a mobile command center, a mobile office building, an urban search and rescue team, and coordination of extra Black Hawk helicopters.",Distant_Evaluation
"Nonetheless, the governor and officials in other states again expressed concern that the problem could occur again as the stretched National Guard system struggled to respond to disasters at home while also fighting overseas.",Distant_Evaluation
"As State Senator Donald Betts Jr., Democrat of Wichita, put it: ''We should have had National Guard troops there right after the tornado hit, securing the place, pulling up debris, to make sure that if there was still life, people could have been saved.",Distant_Evaluation
"The response time was too slow, and it's becoming a trend.",Distant_Evaluation
"We saw this after Katrina, and it's like history repeating itself.''",Distant_Evaluation
"The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which came under strong criticism after Hurricane Katrina, seemed to respond more quickly in Kansas.",Cause_General

State officials said the problem with the National Guard's response had more to do with equipment than personnel.,Distant_Evaluation
"In Kansas, the National Guard is operating with 40 percent to 50 percent of its vehicles and heavy machinery, local Guard officials said.",Cause_Specific
"Ordinarily, the Guard would have about 660 Humvees and more than 30 large trucks to traverse difficult terrain and transport heavy equipment.",Cause_General
"When the tornado struck, the Guard had about 350 Humvees and 15 large trucks, said Maj. Gen. Tod Bunting, the state's adjutant general.",Cause_Specific
"The Guard would also usually have 170 medium-scale tactical vehicles used to transport people and supplies -- but now it has fewer than 30, he said.",Cause_Specific
"On the other hand, General Bunting said, it had more cargo trucks than it needed.",Cause_General
The issue is not confined to Kansas.,Cause_General
"In Ohio, the National Guard is short of night vision goggles and M-4 rifles, said a Guard spokesman, Dr. Mark Wayda.",Cause_General

"Mike Beebe a Democrat, echoed the concerns of Ms. Sebelius.",Distant_Evaluation
"''We have the same problem,'' Mr. Beebe said.",Distant_Evaluation
"''We have had a significant decrease in equipment traditionally afforded our National Guard, and it's occasioned by the fact that it's been sent to the Middle East and Iraq.''",Distant_Evaluation
"He added: ''Our first and foremost consideration is to guarantee that our soldiers have the resources, including equipment, to do the job and protect themselves.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Having said that, my preference would be for the federal government to provide that equipment and not strip the state's resources, which could adversely impact the state's mission in times of crisis, which is what happened in Kansas.''",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Last year, all 50 governors signed a letter to President Bush asking for the immediate re-equipping of Guard units sent overseas.",Distant_Historical
"But officials in several states, including Kentucky, Minnesota and Texas, said Tuesday that they were not facing equipment shortages.",Distant_Evaluation
"National Guard units overseas are often assigned engineering missions, and the skills and equipment -- bulldozers and trucks, for example -- are also what might be required to deal with a natural disaster at home.",Cause_General
"White House officials said that the Kansas National Guard had at its disposal in the Midwest and the Plains states, everything it needed.",Distant_Evaluation
By Mr.,Cause_General
"Snow's count, that included 83,000 National Guard soldiers; 99 bulldozers; 61 loaders; 246 dump trucks and 59 graders.",Cause_General
"''There's a lot of stuff available,'' Mr.",Distant_Evaluation
Snow said.,Distant_Evaluation
"''So, again, I think this is one where the equipment was available and everybody was moving as rapidly as possible.''",Distant_Evaluation
"In Congressional testimony, senior National Guard officials have said that since Sept. 11 units under their command had equipment shortages as forces deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.",Cause_General
"Responding to concerns that the National Guard would not have sufficient personnel or equipment to respond to natural disasters, Guard leaders and state officials developed plans to ensure that if a state is in short supply of people or gear when a hurricane or tornado strikes, it can borrow from other states.",Cause_General
"But borrowing does not solve every problem, state officials said, and coordination can take time.",Distant_Evaluation
"The destruction from Hurricane Katrina ultimately required the help of 50,000 troops -- and they came from all 50 states.",Distant_Historical
Training is another issue.,Distant_Evaluation
"At a Washington news conference in February, Ms. Sebelius said, ''The Guard cannot train on equipment they do not have.''",Distant_Historical
"She added later: ''And in a state like Kansas, where tornados, floods, blizzards and wildfires can seemingly happen all at once, we need our Guardsmen to be as prepared as possible.''",Distant_Historical
Two recent reports have raised questions about Guard preparedness.,Cause_General
"An independent military assessment council, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves, released a report in March that stated: ''In particular, the equipment readiness of the Army National Guard is unacceptable and has reduced the capability of the United States to respond to current and additional major contingencies, foreign and domestic.''",Cause_General
"Another report, released in January by the Government Accountability Office, concluded that the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have ''significantly decreased'' the amount of equipment available for National Guard units not deployed overseas, while the same units face an increasing number of threats at home.",Distant_Historical
"Late Tuesday, in a statement, Ms. Sebelius repeated her message:",Distant_Evaluation

"With memories of his administration's flat-footed response to Hurricane Katrina still lingering, President Bush visited a tornado-wrecked patch of Kansas on Wednesday to pledge administration vigilance in recovery efforts.",Main

Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas over disaster readiness.,Distant_Evaluation
The governor was at his side as he toured the wreckage.,Cause_General
"''Our role as government officials is to work with the states and local folks to get whatever help is appropriate here,'' Mr. Bush said.",Distant_Evaluation
"Speaking to reporters separately, Ms. Sebelius, a Democrat, said, ''There will be money -- federal, state, local,'' adding, ''We have an opportunity to rebuild a real American town.''",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"Behind the scenes, tension remained.",Distant_Evaluation
"On the way to Kansas aboard Air Force One, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, R. David Paulison, was sent to the press cabin to refute the notion that the response in Kansas was anything less than swift and thorough.",Cause_General
"''I've asked probably at least 20 times, Is there anything that you need you don't have?''",Distant_Evaluation
Mr. Paulison said.,Distant_Evaluation
''The answer is no.,Distant_Evaluation
The response in this particular case was absolutely phenomenal.'',Distant_Evaluation
"And officials pointed to positive reviews across the state, including one from Earl Liggett, Kiowa County commissioner, who, referring to the hurricane response, said in an interview: ''I think FEMA was left with some egg on its face there, and they're going to make sure it doesn't happen here, and it hasn't.",Distant_Evaluation
It's been an unbelievable response.'',Distant_Evaluation
But FEMA's response was never at issue in the dispute with Kansas officials.,Distant_Evaluation
"Ms. Sebelius had criticized the shortages of equipment for the local National Guard, which she linked to its heavy deployment in Iraq.",Distant_Evaluation
She did not repeat that criticism on Wednesday.,Cause_General
"She said the response had been ''prompt and good,'' and she added, ''We have a lot of assets here now.''",Distant_Evaluation

"Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, said that if state officials determined they were ill-equipped, ''they'll get what they need, period.''",Distant_Expectations_Consequences

"The Road Home, the Louisiana grant program for homeowners who lost their houses to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, is expected to cost far more than the $7.5 billion provided by the federal government, in part because many more families have applied than officials had anticipated.",Cause_Specific
"As a result, Louisiana officials on Tuesday night set a July 31 deadline for applicants, who can receive up to $150,000 to repair or rebuild their houses.",Main
"With the cutoff date, the state hopes to be able to figure out how much more money it needs to pay for the program; the shortfall is projected to be $2.9 billion.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"The financial woes of the Road Home have set off a frenzy of finger-pointing between federal and state officials, who blame one another for the projected shortfall.",Cause_General
"But it has stirred something close to despair among some Louisiana residents, who were already bemoaning the sluggish way the program has given out the money it does have; only 22,000 families statewide, out of 140,000 applicants, have received grants so far, for a total of $1.3 billion.",Cause_General
"The new problem has reinforced the fears of many in New Orleans that they are being abandoned by the federal government, even as it acknowledges that its levee system failed during Hurricane Katrina.",Distant_Evaluation
"''There's no way they can ever make everybody whole, but they need to fix the thing they broke,'' said Frank A. Silvestri, a New Orleans lawyer and co-founder of the Citizens' Road Home Action Team, which has been critical of the program.",Distant_Evaluation
Evidence that the program is likely to run out of money has been building for several weeks as the state has finally begun making a significant number of grants since the inception of the Road Home nine months ago.,Cause_General
"The grants have averaged about $76,000, which is more than the roughly $60,000 the state predicted last August.",Cause_Specific
State officials say that many more houses turned out to have had severe damage than federal data indicated back when the program was created.,Cause_Specific
"They have also been surprised by a recent surge in applications, which are running at several hundred a day, almost two years after the storms, said Gentry Brann, director of communications for the program.",Distant_Evaluation
"The state also expected private insurance companies to cover a larger percentage of the damage, said Walter J. Leger Jr., a lawyer and member of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which created the Road Home program.",Distant_Evaluation
"''Anecdotally, the companies aren't paying,'' Mr. Leger said.",Distant_Evaluation
"''National Flood Insurance paid out, but private insurers didn't.''",Cause_Specific
Insurance benefits are generally subtracted from grants awarded by the program.,Cause_General
"But Mr. Leger and other state officials concede that many homeowners may have preferred to try to get larger grants from the Road Home, rather than fight with their insurers.",Distant_Evaluation
"The Bush administration contends that the state itself created the shortfall by paying for home damage caused by wind, rather than limiting the program to flood damage.",Cause_Specific
Insurance policies are more likely to cover wind damage than flood damage.,Cause_General
"The decision to pay for wind damage added about 43,000 houses to the likely total covered by the program, at a cost of about $2.6 billion, according to data from the office of Donald E. Powell, President Bush's coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding.",Cause_Specific
"Even so, Mr. Powell ''is not opposed to additional funding -- if the state can make a clear case for more funds,'' his spokeswoman, Susan Aspey, wrote in an e-mail message.",Distant_Evaluation
"''He wants to get this resolved as quickly as possible for the people of Louisiana, and he's indicated his willingness to sit down with the governor and her staff to work towards that end.''",Distant_Evaluation
"State officials, from the governor on down, say the program has always covered wind damage, and that they do not understand why Mr. Powell is raising the issue so late in the game.",Distant_Evaluation
"The state had a similar run-in with the Department of Housing and Urban Development over the way it paid out the grant money, and ended up changing the program in April.",Cause_General
Louisiana is also fighting the Federal Emergency Management Agency for more than $1 billion it was counting on for the Road Home program.,Cause_General
FEMA says it cannot release the money -- intended for hazard-mitigation efforts like elevating houses -- because the Road Home discriminates against younger people by exempting people 65 and older from a requirement that grant recipients live in their rebuilt houses for three years.,Cause_General
"Further complicating the financial picture is the fact that the state treasury is running a budget surplus of about $3 billion, which some in Washington have argued should be used to bail out the Road Home.",Cause_General
"A United States Senate subcommittee that held a hearing on the program last week is likely to recommend ways to fix it in a report to be released in June, said Stephanie Allen, a spokeswoman for Senator Mary L. Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat who is chairwoman of the subcommittee.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences

"GENEVA - The U.N. human rights chief, Navi Pillay, on Friday condemned Iraq’s execution of 42 prisoners over two days this week, denouncing such mass executions as “obscene and inhuman” and warning that they undermined efforts to reduce violence and achieve a more stable society.",Main
"Iraq’s justice system is “too deeply flawed to warrant even a limited use of the death penalty, let alone dozens of executions at a time,” Pillay said in a statement released in Geneva, repeating a view she has expressed on several occasions.",Distant_Evaluation
"At least some of the latest executions, which were carried out Wednesday and Thursday, breached international law because Iraq is unable to hold fair trials, Pillay’s spokesman, Rupert Colville, told reporters.",Distant_Evaluation
"And Iraq’s decision to proceed with executions Thursday, which was World Day Against the Death Penalty, was “particularly perverse,” Pillay said.",Distant_Evaluation
"Iraq’s Justice Ministry said the executed prisoners had been convicted of “terrorist crimes, killing dozens of innocents in addition to other crimes aimed at destabilizing the country, causing chaos and spreading horror.”",Cause_General
Pillay also expressed concern about the “dramatic and shocking increase” in Iraq’s resort to the death penalty.,Distant_Evaluation
"This week’s executions brought to 140 the number of people executed so far this year, compared with 123 in 2012 and 18 in 2010, the United Nations reported.",Cause_General
"Pillay will be in direct contact with Iraqi authorities in the coming days, Colville said, but in the meantime she urged the government to immediately halt executions and to commute the sentences of about 900 prisoners now held on death row.",Main_Consequence
"U.N. human rights officials say the integrity of the judicial system has been tainted, citing the numerous reports of confessions obtained through torture and ill-treatment, the weakness of the judiciary and trial procedures that fall far short of international standards.",Distant_Evaluation
"They also said some of the offenses for which prisoners are executed did not meet the threshold of “most serious crimes,” which international law sets for the use of the death penalty.",Distant_Evaluation
"Iraq’s justification for using the death penalty as a deterrent to terrorism was “clearly exposed as a fallacy” by the sharp rise in civilian casualties over the same period, Pillay noted.",Distant_Evaluation
"The rash of recent bombings in the capital, Baghdad, and other parts of the country had driven up civilian casualties to the highest level since 2008, Pillay observed.",Cause_General

"Erich Priebke, a former SS captain who was sentenced to life in prison for helping to organize the execution of 335 men and boys at the Ardeatine Caves in Italy in 1944, died Friday under house arrest at his home in Rome.",Main
He was 100 and the oldest surviving convicted Nazi war criminal.,Cause_General
"He “died of old age,” said his lawyer, Paolo Giachini.",Cause_Specific
"Priebke was at the center of one of the most contentious Nazi war-crimes prosecutions of the 1990s, begun after an American television crew tracked him down in Argentina at San Carlos de Bariloche, a resort city in the foothills of the Andes.",Distant_Historical
"Priebke fled to South America soon after World War II and had been living under his real name, owning a butcher shop and traveling to Europe - and even Italy - with a German passport.",Distant_Historical
He was extradited to Italy in November 1995 and ordered to stand trial before an Italian military tribunal the next year.,Distant_Historical
"The proceedings - described at the time as possibly the last Nazi war-crimes trial in Europe - centered on the massacre at the Ardeatine Caves, just south of Rome, on March 24, 1944.",Distant_Historical
The men and boys were rounded up and killed in reprisal for an attack in which Italian partisans killed 33 members of a Nazi security force.,Distant_Historical
"Herbert Kappler, the Gestapo chief in Rome, ordered the deaths of 10 Italians for every dead policeman.",Distant_Historical
Seventy-five of the 335 victims were Jewish.,Distant_Historical
"By many accounts, the captives were led into the caves with their hands tied behind their backs, forced to kneel - many over the bodies of those already killed - and shot in the neck.",Distant_Historical
Priebke said he was responsible for exceeding the quota by five.,Distant_Evaluation
"“It went wrong,” he was quoted as saying in an article published in the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung a week before his death.",Distant_Evaluation
The prosecution in Italy was a protracted affair.,Distant_Evaluation
The military tribunal that tried Priebke in 1996 ended up ordering him freed.,Distant_Historical
"While finding him guilty of involvement in the massacre, the court acquitted him of acting with premeditation and cruelty.",Distant_Historical
Only a conviction on those counts would have sent him to prison because of a 30-year statute of limitations on murder charges.,Distant_Evaluation
"His release caused an international outcry, and he was rearrested after an appellate court ordered another trial by military tribunal.",Distant_Historical
"In July 1997, the second military court sentenced him to 15 years in prison, but reduced that term to five years, saying there had been mitigating factors, including Priebke’s assertion that he had acted under orders.",Distant_Historical
"Prosecutors appealed, and in March 1998 Priebke was sentenced to life, a verdict that was upheld by the Court of Cassation, Italy’s highest appellate court.",Distant_Historical
"Because of his age, Priebke was put under house arrest.",Distant_Historical
"Two soldiers kept watch day and night outside the apartment block in western Rome where Priebke lived, and two police officers followed him whenever he left the residence, according to the account in Sueddeutsche Zeitung, by Malte Herwig.",Cause_General
"Referring to Hannah Arendt’s famous phrase about the Nazis when she covered the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Israel, Herwig, who has done extensive research on the Nazi era, described his encounter with Priebke as “the last chance to investigate that supposed banality of evil with a living person.”",Distant_Evaluation
"Priebke was born on July 29, 1913, in Hennigsdorf, near Berlin.",Distant_Historical
"His parents both died early in his life, he told Herwig, and he was reared largely by an uncle.",Distant_Historical
Little is known of his early life.,Cause_General
"As World War II ended, he was imprisoned by the British but eventually fled to a German-speaking area in the north of Italy, where he reunited with his wife and two sons, according to Herwig.",Distant_Historical
"The family fled by way of Genoa to Argentina, where Priebke worked as a waiter and then opened a butcher shop.",Distant_Historical
"His commander at the time of the massacre, Kappler, was sentenced to life in prison in 1948 by a Rome court.",Distant_Historical
He was smuggled out of a military hospital in 1997 and died in freedom in Germany the following year.,Distant_Historical
"Karl Hass, an SS major, was convicted with Priebke in July 1997 and given a life sentence in 1998.",Distant_Historical
He died while under house arrest in 2004.,Distant_Historical
Priebke is survived by his two sons and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.,Cause_General
His lawyer said he would be buried in Argentina.,Main_Consequence
"In recent years, Priebke remained a rallying point both for neo-Nazis and their opponents.",Distant_Evaluation
"In July, members of Jewish groups and other protesters gathered near his home on the occasion of his 100th birthday to read the names of the massacre’s victims.",Distant_Historical

"The law firms Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman are in advanced merger talks, with an announcement of a deal expected as early as next week.",Main
"A combination would create one of the country’s 10 largest firms with about 1,700 lawyers.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
The discussions underscore the pressure on corporate law firms to grow their businesses amid persistently soft demand for legal services and the increasing globalization of the corporate law industry.,Cause_General
"“Our firms are in exploratory discussions about a possible combination,” James Rishwain, the chairman of Pillsbury, and Mitch Zuklie, the chairman of Orrick, said in a joint statement.",Main
“These talks are serving to confirm the great respect our firms have for each other.”,Distant_Evaluation
People close to the talks said that the deal could still fall apart but that they were far along.,Distant_Evaluation
"Typically, the executive committees of each firm agree to the main terms of a merger and then the entire partnerships vote at a later date.",Cause_General
The news was first reported by Reuters.,Cause_General
"Mergers among the nation’s 100 largest firms once occurred infrequently, and marriages involving top firms were rarer still.",Distant_Evaluation
"But today, firms are under pressure to add to their practices quickly to break into new geographic markets and practice areas.",Cause_General
"And some legal industry studies have concluded that size matters in corporate law - the larger the firm, the stronger the brand.",Distant_Evaluation
"Law firm mergers are booming, and a combination of Orrick and Pillsbury would be the year’s largest.",Distant_Evaluation
"Fifty-eight law firms had announced mergers as of the end of September, a 41 percent increase from the same period last year, according to survey by Altman Weil, a legal industry consulting firm.",Cause_General
"In 2012, the large Houston firm, Fulbright & Jaworksi, joined forces with Norton Rose in Britain, creating a firm of nearly 4,000 lawyers.",Distant_Historical
"Dentons, a firm of about 2,500 lawyers, is in talks to acquire McKenna Long & Aldridge in a deal that would push its lawyer count to more than 3,000.",Cause_General
But law firm mergers carry significant risk.,Distant_Evaluation
"For starters, there is a possibility that the leaking of merger talks can have a destabilizing effect on the firms involved, leading to defections by important partners who may disapprove of a deal or fear a lesser role - or less compensation - at the combined firm.",Distant_Evaluation
Big law firm deals have a mixed track record and often result in power struggles and cultural clashes.,Distant_Evaluation
"Most infamously, the 2007 merger of Dewey Ballantine and LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae - the largest merger of New York law firms in history - was a fiasco.",Distant_Historical
"Last year, the combined firm, Dewey & LeBoeuf, collapsed in bankruptcy amid financial mismanagement and partner defections.",Distant_Historical
"In 2006, Orrick had flirted with possible disaster when it had agreed to the main terms of a combination with Dewey Ballantine, but the deal fell apart after several top partners jumped ship when merger talks were leaked.",Distant_Historical
"Orrick, with 1,100 lawyers, has talked with several firms over the past decade but never made it to the altar.",Cause_General
"Pillsbury, too, recently discussed a deal with Fulbright.",Cause_General
"Although today each has offices across the globe, both Orrick’s and Pillsbury’s historical roots are firmly grounded on the West Coast.",Cause_General
Each was started in San Francisco in the 1860s in the wake of the California gold rush.,Distant_Historical

"Newsweek, the struggling weekly magazine that ceased print publication last year, plans to turn the presses back on.",Main
"The magazine will begin a 64-page, weekly edition in January or February, said Jim Impoco, Newsweek’s editor in chief.",Main
He said in an interview that Newsweek would depend more heavily on subscribers than advertisers to pay its bills and that readers would pay more for Newsweek than in the past.,Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"“It’s going to be a more subscription-based model, closer to what The Economist is, compared to what Time magazine is,” Impoco said.",Distant_Expectations_Consequences
"“We see it as a premium product, a boutique product.”",Distant_Evaluation
Newsweek’s return to print is a positive sign for a magazine that struggled mightily in the digital age.,Distant_Evaluation
"At its height in 1991, the magazine had 3.3 million readers.",Distant_Historical
"In 2010, Newsweek’s owner, The Washington Post, sold it to billionaire investor Sidney Harman for $1.",Distant_Historical
"Harman, who also assumed $40 million in liabilities, then merged it with The Daily Beast, the website owned by IAC/InterActiveCorp.",Distant_Historical
"Editor Tina Brown took control of the combined titles, but the venture failed.",Distant_Historical
The traditional Newsweek never properly blended with The Daily Beast.,Distant_Evaluation
"Brown announced in October 2012 that Newsweek would no longer publish a magazine, saving $40 million a year, and would continue as an online-only magazine called Newsweek Global.",Distant_Historical
"Still, removing those print costs did not mean Newsweek had found a solution.",Distant_Evaluation
"In May, Brown announced that IAC/InterActiveCorp planned to sell Newsweek, so that the company could focus its attention on The Daily Beast.",Distant_Historical
