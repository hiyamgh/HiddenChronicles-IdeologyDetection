"If there were an award for scummiest business practice , refusing to pay interns would get many a vote .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But Jan Mortier , who until a year ago ran a ""junior associates"" programme through his thinktank Civitatis International , has upped the stakes by charging former interns (or trainees , as he prefers to think of them) a ? 300 fee for an employment reference .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is charging someone for a reference after refusing to pay them as scummy as it gets? Sadly not .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Young people are lucky if unpaid work is the worst deal they are offered : although the ""junior associates"" programme was advertised on Internwise , the three-month programme cost more than ? 1,600 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Mortier insists it was a training course, not an internship .) And the winner is  ...  But how on Earth did Mortier think he could get away with charging for references , never mind the extortionate fee of ? 300? His market is ambitious but terrified young people who are overqualified and unemployed - and there is easy money to be made from them, for three reasons .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  they've been sent the message that they're of little value to the economy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Government and businesses have spent the entire economic crisis suggesting that young people lack employable skills .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Repeated references to these elusive skills rarely lead to any kind of specific mention of what they are - or an investigation into why schools and universities stopped teaching them just as the economy collapsed .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you've spent your life in education only to be called unemployable , the idea that you'd have to pay someone to say nice things about you doesn't seem so far-fetched .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second , while young people as a group tend not to have much money sloshing around , their parents and grandparents are supposedly doing OK .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People wanting what's best for their kids leads easily to the coughing-up of cash .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Third , when it comes to looking for a job , young people are so used to mounting hindrances that you can stick on another like an extra bottle on a drunk's bar tab .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Legend has it that people used to get a job by seeing one they wanted , and applying ; then came the time when they needed qualifications to get the same job ; then they needed better qualifications ; then they would have to do an unpaid internship ; then to prove it wasn't all a fluke they'd have to get qualifications and do an internship .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now ,  Civitatis would have you believe that if you attend its summer school you ""will gain the advantage over others for internship (sic)"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, 300 for a reference? Stick it on the bill .",other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the damage caused by charging for references isn't limited to the spineless gouging of money from naive young people trying to get their first job .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A reference is immediately invalid once money changes hands .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The value of a reference lies in the assumption that it's an honest comment on a person's job performance or character .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The price tag Mortier has attached isn't , as he claims, a ""fair administrative fee"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's enough to make a pocket bulge, and certainly enough to be considered a bribe : no one pays ? 300 to be damned with faint praise .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Anyone reading a reference signed by Mortier knows he's been paid hundreds for whatever he's written , so it will ring hollow .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Getting a job with worthless education and months-long application processes is already hard enough .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If this idea catches on , references as a measure of a potential candidate will be as devalued as our degrees .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"On Monday afternoon, Senator Dianne Feinstein released a letter to Barack Obama , suggesting a series of reforms ""to make sure that the United States never again engages in actions that you have acknowledged were torture"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A month after her office released the landmark (but still heavily redacted) Senate torture report , Feinstein is now calling for legislation to strengthen the prohibition against torture .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a laudable and necessary step , but torture has been a felony for decades .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So have war crimes, lying to Congress and obstruction of justice .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fundamental problem is that the US government has been unable or unwilling to enforce those laws against the CIA .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If reform does not confront the reasons for that failure , it may not deter the United States from engaging in torture under a future president .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To the extent that federal prosecutors have simply lacked the political will to investigate the CIA , there' s not much Congress can do about it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But legislation could address many of the other factors that allowed the CIA to torture prisoners, destroy evidence and lie to investigators with impunity .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is the CIA's reliance on secret ""torture memos"" written by the Office of Legal Counsel  - which exploited some weaknesses in the legal definition of torture , but depended far more heavily on absurd legal arguments and false representations of fact by the CIA .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There' s the unethical role of CIA doctors and psychologists in monitoring interrogations .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And above all, there remains the CIA's ability to keep all the evidence of its crimes classified .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The only explanation the justice department has ever provided for the failure to indict a single CIA officer for torture, war crimes, homicide, destruction of evidence or any of the other crimes the Senate report documents is a bland statement that ""the admissible evidence would not be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The justice department refuses to answer questions about the role played by top-secret classification in that decision, or disclose any of the records from the criminal investigations .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But we do know that until the Senate report was released , the Obama administration took the position that every detail of an individual detainee's torture in CIA custody was top secret - including former CIA prisoners' memories of their own treatment, the locations of black sites and the names of all the witnesses .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We know the CIA redacted from the report not only the names but even the pseudonyms of nearly every CIA officer and contractor involved in the program, and every country that hosted a black site .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And we know that every last civil suit brought by CIA torture victims has been dismissed on national security grounds .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So it's difficult to imagine how a prosecutor could have made a torture case against the CIA without disclosing this evidence - and even harder to imagine the agency allowing its release .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In theory, Obama's December 2009 executive order on national security classification should prevent the CIA from using secrecy to place itself beyond the rule of law , since the order specifically forbids classifying information to ""conceal violations of law"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In practice, though, the prohibition is virtually never enforced .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Obama administration - like the Bush administration before it - takes the position that the CIA's criminal actions can be legitimately classified if they are ""intelligence sources and methods"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And neither Congress, nor the president, nor the courts have imposed any legal limit on what counts as an intelligence source or method .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In practice, the phrase has come to mean ""anything the intelligence community doesn't want you to know."" Congress needs to write a legal definition of ""intelligence sources and methods"" that imposes real limits, and makes clear that it excludes torture and other crimes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Feinstein and her staff deserve tremendous credit for finally breaking through the wall of secrecy that the CIA built around its torture program, in the face of fierce opposition from the agency and the White House .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But their investigation did not begin until after the black-site program had already ended, in large part because of leaks to the press .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite staffers' scrupulous protection of classified information, the CIA subjected them to unlawful surveillance, tried to have them prosecuted and is still trying to retaliate .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet the report is still full of unjustified redactions , and the Department of Justice refuses to either reopen its criminal investigations into torture or explain why they were closed in the first place .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As it stands right now , torture is a crime - but so is revealing evidence of torture that the CIA wants hidden .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And it's only the second crime that gets you prosecuted .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, let's strengthen the laws against torture .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But let's also weaken the CIA's power to conceal the evidence .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Europeans seem to be grappling with this one question : how do I live alongside people of a different cultural background, the Other?  In times like this, literature and history can help us see things more clearly .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I turned to the Polish writer Ryszard Kapuscinski , who spent most of his life travelling across the developing world and reflecting on how Europeans relate to that huge part of the global population that is non- European, and much poorer than Europeans .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In his book The Other, Kapuscinski  - who had flaws as a journalist, but certainly didn't lack curiosity for different cultures - points out how difficult it is for inhabitants of the old continent to accept that ""the map of the world has changed"" since decolonisation in the 1960s .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After dominating the globe for hundreds of years , Europeans still have trouble dealing with the fact that they have become less central, less overpowering .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And yet it is a paradox , because Europe produced arguably the first world citizen open to discovering and appreciating foreign cultures : the Greek historian Herodotus, 2,500 years ago .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We may be baffled by changes , but there were times when we lived with much more diversity in our midst .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tony Judt is great to read on this .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In his book Postwar, he recalls how ""the European continent was once a complex tapestry of languages, religions, communities, and nations that overlapped .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many of its cities - including some of the smallest, at the intersection of old and new imperial borders, such as Trieste, Sarajevo, Salonica, Czernowitz, Odessa, Vilnius - were truly multicultural, with Catholics, Orthodox, Muslims, Jews and others mingling.""  Judt goes on : ""Between 1914 and 1945, however, this Europe was reduced to ashes."" As a result of war, occupation, border changes, expulsions and genocide, most people ended up living among people like them, in different states .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During the cold war, the two halves of Europe lived in ""hermetic national enclaves"" - a world of homogeneity , notes Judt .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the 1960s immigrants arrived in western Europe to provide a workforce, most from former colonies .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Judt calls this a ""new presence of 'others' living in Europe"" , including the millions of Muslims in today's EU .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He says this presence ""has outlined not only Europe's discomfort as it is faced with a renewed and growing diversity , but also the ease with which the 'other' dead of Europe's past had crept out of people's minds"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So there it is : today's intolerance has its roots not just in economic frustration, but in amnesia .",other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Campbell Newman's LNP government won power in 2012 in a huge landslide - and polls suggest that most of those gains are expected to be swept away as Queensland politics returns to normality .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2012, the sitting Labor government's seats in the parliament were cut savagely from 51 to seven .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The LNP opposition increased their seats from 34 to 78 .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the new parliament, there were seven government members for every member of the opposition and crossbench .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since 2012 , the LNP has lost two seats to Labor at by-elections , and three other MPs elected for the LNP now sit on the crossbench .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite these changes , the LNP has a massive majority and a large swing will be required for a change in government .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because of the huge swing in 2012, it's hard to predict which seats will be the key battlegrounds .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a normal election campaign, you would look first at the seats held by the government by the smallest margins (those seats they came closest to losing at the previous election) .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet in Queensland, most LNP seats on slim margins are seats traditionally considered to be ""safe"" Labor seats  - if Labor has any chance of taking power , you would expect those seats to fall easily and the election to focus on seats further along the pendulum .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the last election, it was estimated that the LNP won 62.8% of the vote after preferences .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recent polls indicate there has been a large swing back to Labor .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most recent Newspoll had Labor and the LNP tied on 50% each .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These polls suggest that Labor is in with a chance of winning the election , despite the massive number of seats they need to gain .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to ward off this threat , the LNP will likely need to sacrifice many of its seats in order to focus energy on those seats they can retain .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Labor needs a uniform swing of approximately 12.5% to win the 36 extra seats they need to win a majority .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Current polling suggests that Labor is close to that number , and this suggests that most of the seats that will be key battlegrounds are seats the LNP now holds by margins of 10-15% , but there will be seats that swing more or less than the average .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you focus on those with margins of between 10% and 15% , there are a smattering of seats in Brisbane, as well as four seats on the Gold Coast, one on the Sunshine Coast, one in Townsville and two rural seats near Mackay .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An international study released last week has identified that those who work more than 48 hours a week are 11% more likely to drink alcohol at risk levels than those working a standard week .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The study was compiled by Finnish researchers , sampling 300,000 subjects across Europe, Australia and North America .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Health guidelines suggest that consumption of more than 14 drinks a week for women and 21 drinks for men poses a significant health risk .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Australian research released only last July revealed up to 15 people die and more than 430 are admitted to hospital every day in Australia for alcohol-related reasons .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That working longer hours has a detrimental effect on an individual's health is well established .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some have suggested from the results of the Finnish study that alcohol abuse is symptomatic of the ""work hard, play hard"" cultures around professions - especially because workers who shifted into longer-hours jobs during the study were 12% more likely to develop risky drinking habits as a result .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some have also suggested that the scarcity of leisure time for people who work long hours may result in habits of using alcohol as a concentrated form of relaxant .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is the opinion of Cassandra A  Okechukwu, assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who declared of the Finnish findings that ""people are self-medicating"" due to work-life time constraints .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alternatively, Dr Richard Wise, psychologist at Windana Drug and Alcohol Recovery, believes the relationship between work and drinking may be bi- directional .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""As stress increases the activity of brain regions responsible for drug seeking and craving , stressful work is often 'addictive' in itself,"" says Wise .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""This could be a self-perpetuating cycle - work causes stress , which renders people more prone to addictions to substances and work.""  Significantly ,  the study itself does not claim to prove a causation - leaving open the possibility to discuss the pink elephant that lurks in the room behind all social discussions of problem drinking: the prevalent, if sometimes well-camouflaged, existence of actual alcoholics .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Writing in Business Insider , journalist Kevin Loria asked of the study : ""Long hours may not cause dangerous drinking , but why is there a relationship between those two things at all?"" The answer is this : there is not one clear relationship, but potentially several .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We know, for example , that those suffering active alcoholism seek out environments that facilitate and camouflage their drinking .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why would the workplace be an exception?  Demanding jobs not only deliver alcoholics out of the worksite just in time for socially-acceptable drinking hours , but the stresses associated with long - hours work provide pretexts aplenty for ""self-medicating"" with booze .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our community continues to excuse the practise of drowning one's sorrows , but forgotten is that active alcoholics often go looking for sorrows in order to drown them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The recovery community calls this phenomenon ""drinking on it"" - it's not hard to find a pretext to slam down some craved-for cold ones at the end of the day if you've just spent 10 hours at a desk .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And if there' s one thing an alcoholic can use to deny the extent of their drinking`cond , it's the company of others who share the same problem .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The common logic of alcohol addiction brings alcoholics together in work environments as much as it does social ones .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet while study after study identifies alcohol as a health, economic and justice burden on the community, and with the statistical acknowledgement that 3.7 million Australians are currently ""drinking at long-term risky levels"" , we're still - still - struggling to break our social addiction to the old stereotypes of alcoholics being weak-willed, staggering hobos rather than predominantly people with jobs, relationships and families who are sick with a dangerous medical problem .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If we choose to believe someone is drinking because they work long hours , we may be ignoring that someone is working long hours because it enables their drinking .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A failure to identify behaviours symptomatic with alcoholism delays treatment and increases the danger alcoholics pose to themselves and to others .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Go back and look at the figures above: 5,500+ deaths and 150,000+ hospital admissions a year are not the result of mere casual tipples .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"What stops a man from beating up and raping his female partner? According to research published today, it is not sanctions imposed by the criminal justice system, such as prison or probation, but attending a course with other abusers .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Domestic violence perpetrator programmes (DVPPs): steps towards change"" , by the feminist academics Liz Kelly and Nicole Westmarland, is based on interviews with men who attend programmes that aim to re-educate them about their behaviour to improve the safety of women and children .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The research  - which also draws on the experiences of partners of the violent men, a small number of children and the staff of these programmes - finds that ""the vast majority of men who abuse their partners stop their physical and sexual violence if they attend a DVPP"" and that such programmes ""could play an important role in the quest to end domestic violence"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the figures look impressive .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example , before attending the programme a third of men asked women to perform sexual acts against their wishes , but none did so after taking part .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cases of the men using a weapon against their partner reduced from 29% to nil .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But there are other findings that give me cause for concern .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ninety per cent of the men interviewed had, prior to the course, made excuses about and attempted to justify their abusive behaviour .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After the course, this tendency had barely reduced at all, with almost three-quarters of the men still making excuses .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over the years , when making plain my scepticism about DVPPs I have been told that the aim of such courses is to make perpetrators accountable and get them to face up to what they have done .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This finding shows that this is one of the weakest outcomes .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What about prevention of domestic violence? Does the existence of these courses deter others from using their fists to settle an argument? On average, two women in England and Wales die each week as a result of domestic violence, a figure that has remained constant for decades .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I can't imagine a government - led information campaign with the slogan , ""Violent men beware! Beat up your wife and go on a course"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over half of the women reported feeling ""very safe"" after the programme, compared with less than one in 10 before it .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But that leaves almost half of the women still in fear .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One major tactic used by violent men is to control the household finances so that the woman is totally reliant on him and has no means of escape .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The research found that after DVPP, this behaviour changed ""only marginally"" .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is also some evidence that DVPPs do not necessarily encourage women to leave violent men .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The researchers used a control group of women who were accessing support for domestic violence but whose partner was not attending a DVPP in order to compare results .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The control group also reported a significant reduction in violence from the men, but were more likely to end the relationship with the abuser than the women whose partners were attending a DVPP .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps such programmes act as marriage guidance counselling and help keep couples together? Is this not dangerous?  The impression given by the widespread acceptability of these programmes is that those who beat and rape their partners are in need of support and help, not punishment .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are moves by the Home Office to roll out restorative justice measures in cases of sexual and domestic violence , and a recent government inquiry into stalking legislation posed the question of whether ""treatment programmes should be available for perpetrators and , if so , what should be their content?""  According to Nicole Westmarland, one of the report authors , ""we have hardly any knowledge about how things like probation, fines, or even prison affect men's attitudes and behaviours towards women"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is true, but mainly because so few perpetrators are held to account by the courts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We appear to have given up the battle to have domestic violence treated as a crime like any other  - which used to be the feminist mantra - and have now declared the criminal justice system unfit for purpose in dealing with violence in the home .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We should not be giving up on the justice system before its potential effectiveness has been truly tested .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are many ways its approach to domestic violence could be improved .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pilot programmes should be rolled out nationwide , directing police to mandatorily arrest those who have committed acts of violence towards partners or ex-partners .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This way , perpetrators will realise that it is not the decision of their victims to send them to court , so victims will be in no further danger of revenge for doing so .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Crown Prosecution Service needs to take a more robust approach in getting perpetrators to court and speed up the process so the victim does not have to wait months for an outcome .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During this process, the victims involved should be protected and supported by state-funded initiatives .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Public education campaigns that aim to tug on the heartstrings of abusers, such as posters depicting women crying and sporting injuries , should be swapped for images of men in handcuffs or in a prison cell .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Young women and men need to be educated about what is at the root of domestic and sexual violence - that it is a cause and consequence of inequality and sexism .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People who beat their partners are making a choice .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We need to make sure the message that this is a serious crime, not an illness, is disseminated in schools .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Last week's massacre of perhaps 2,000 people in and around the Nigerian town of Baga, and the bombings of markets in the north-east using children perhaps as young as 10, mark not a new tactic for the violent extremist organisation Boko Haram, but an intensification of its existing behaviour .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And what can be done to stop it?  Nigeria's military is around 130,000-strong, and has been previously lauded for its peacekeeping successes in civil conflicts in Africa , but now ,  with a worsening conflict at home, questions are being asked about just how hollowed out such an important institution has become .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are varying reports as to why the 8,500 troops deployed to battle Boko Haram have been unable to halt its advance .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They discovered that RBC - Royal Bank of Canada - had done something cruel and unusual even by banking standards .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was obliging junior staff to train a group of temporary foreign workers , who would then be given the staff's jobs .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just after the first report was aired, according to the website Canadaland , something odd happened : journalists preparing to expand on the investigation were summoned to a conference call with Amanda Lang, CBC's senior business correspondent and a star presenter .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were astonished .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"First ,  that Lang had spoken at a series of events run or sponsored by RBC  - for which she appears, on one occasion , to have been paid around 15,000 Canadian dollars .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second , that she was booked to speak at an event sponsored by the outsourcing company the bank had hired to implement the cruel practice exposed by her colleagues .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lang then interviewed the bank's chief executive on her own show .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When he dismissed the story as unfair and misleading , she did not challenge him .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That evening she uncritically repeated his talking points on CBC's main current affairs programme .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Then she wrote a comment article for the Globe and Mail newspaper suggesting that her colleagues' story arose from an outdated suspicion of business, was dangerous to Canada's interests, and was nothing but ""a sideshow"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Here's what she said about the bank's employment practices : ""It's called capitalism , and it isn't a dirty word.""  Canadaland , which exposed Lang's conflicts last week , found that other journalists at the broadcaster were furious, but too frightened to speak on the record .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But after CBC tried to dismiss the scandal as ""half-truths based on anonymous sources"" , Kathy Tomlinson, the reporter who had broken the story about the bank , bravely spoke publicly to the website .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why does it matter?  There' s certainly something compelling about Harris' daring bid for US Senate : there are only one in five senators are female in this Congress ; and there are only two black Senators currently (Cory Booker of New Jersey and Tim Scott from South Carolina) .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If Harris won , she not only would contribute to the growing number of women in power , but having three actual black senators at one time would make history because , to date, two is the best we've been able to achieve as a nation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In America's entire history , only eight black people have ever been senators and of those, only half were actually elected, rather than appointed .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet African-Americans make up about 13% of the population, according to the 2013 census .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
True proportional representation would see black senators in the double digits in Congress .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"California has outsized importance in the US economy : on its own, it is the world's eighth-largest economy, just behind booming Brazil but ahead of Russia and Italy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
California's contributions are one of the chief reasons the US remains the world's biggest economy ... and a black woman is poised to be one of the most nationally influential politicians in the state .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"California's internal public policy tussles - and its standard more-liberal- than-the-nation solutions - often help lead the rest of the nation and the world forward, be it on pollution standards, minimum wage increases, medical marijuana legalization, organic produce certification, healthcare access for the uninsured, public-private technology innovation such as iHubs and tax breaks that encourage local production of zero-emission Teslas , same sex marriage and wetlands protections such as the CA Coastal Act of 1976 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"California's politicians can bring to Washington the ability to combine strong, safe regulatory experience with a booming economy and environmental protections , offering a compelling counter-point to Republicans who argue otherwise .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And ,  with the exception of Jerry Brown's first stint as governor from 1975-1983, California internal top politics has been tended to be dominated by southern California figures like Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger - but Harris (and Newsom) are both northern California people through and through .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead of Hollywood values and priorities holding sway in the state, northern California's tech-powered financial and cultural strength may finally have a chance to drive the state's politics .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And while Boxer, her fellow senator Dianne Feinstein and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi all hail from northern California , they spend much of their time in Washington DC  - so Harris's move to DC will provide us with a new generation of representatives steeped in the area's emerging tech-focused culture .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While I believe California has much to gain from politicians like Newsom and Harris who see their work as largely cooperative and people-focused - as opposed to the ideological culture warriors who normally represent us in national policy debates - there's a long road ahead for each .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Harris, for instance, may have to contend with billionaire Tom Steyer and former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in a Democratic primary (and Villaraigosa would make history of his own) .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It must have helped perpetuate the brand, that first contest , for it was between the two men whose lives and deaths shadowed the rest of the American century : the beautiful young upstart John F Kennedy and the so much less telegenic, even rather sweaty, Richard Nixon .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cameron's people have been trying to back out of TV debates in 2015 almost since the lights went down on the last debate of the last election campaign .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current state of the US and UK governments' ass-backwards approach to cybersecurity was on full display this week - culminating with British Prime Minister David Cameron and President Obama meeting to discuss the issue at the White House on Friday .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When it comes to cybersecurity , it seems the UK and US want to embrace every crazy idea except what we know actually works .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The UK's Cameron suggested earlier in the week he wants to outlaw certain forms of encryption , which could potentially lead to some of the world's most popular messaging apps (like iMessage and WhatsApp) being banned in the UK .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That speech had been ridiculed from all angles for the past few days, with various experts labeling it a nightmare for Internet security - on par with authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China - and economically devastating for the British information technology industry .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile ,  the White House has proposed a huge expansion of penalties under the highly-controversial law that was used to prosecute Reddit co-founder and privacy rights advocate Aaron Swartz .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If passed , the administration's proposal could further criminalize mundane Internet activity - for example , potentially allowing for a ten-year jail sentence for sharing your HBO GO password  - all to supposedly target foreign hackers that the law would likely never reach .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Less than 24 hours before Cameron-Obama the meeting , the Guardian published a secret report based on previously unreleased Snowden documents showing that the US government is fully aware that encryption is vital for security , and that the government risked leaving themselves vulnerable if they didn't start implementing it on their own systems quicker .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The British government likely knows this too : many of their employees use email encryption ; and UK even recommend citizens use encryption to protect their data on a government website .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the press conference after the meeting, Obama commendably didn't embrace Cameron's proposal when asked about it , and even Cameron seemed to at least appear to back off his own anti-encryption proclamation , saying he's ""not trying to enunciate some new doctrine.""  But just because Cameron's been proven to be technically illiterate and may be attempting to publicly back away from his most radical proposal , that doesn't mean that he won't later push forward .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FBI director Jim Comey proposed similar legislation to Cameron's just a few months ago , and Cameron used eerily similar talking points in Washington on Friday as Comey did in late 2014 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Plus, the rest of Cameron's plan is downright scary for Internet privacy even without a formal encryption ban .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And then there's the White House's so-called solution to the cybersecurity problem , which they unveiled earlier this week .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Obama introduced it saying we had to do something about incidents like the headline-grabbing Sony hack, or the juvenile hijacking of US Central Command's twitter account - but what he didn't say was that those proposals wouldn't have stopped those attacks at all .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Part of the Obama administration's proposal would dramatically expand the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the oft-abused and notorious statute that the Justice Department used to threaten the late Internet activist Aaron Swartz with 35 years in jail .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Aaron later took his own life while awaiting trial .) The CFAA already has incredibly harsh penalties, so much so that there's been a movement for years to reduce them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And how the administration thinks increasing CFAA penalties is going to worry either North Korean hackers or ISIS sympathizers (or more likely pranksters) who take advantage of negligent password practices is anyone's guess .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It would also put countless security researchers at further risk of prosecution, the exact type of people the government should consulting with before making these ill-thought proposals, not driving underground .",no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the same time ,  Congress has re-introduced their annual ""info-sharing"" cybersecurity bill , which is really just a thinly-veiled way to siphon off more of Americans' private data without court oversight .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As EFF put it , the bill ""offered new authorities that could be abused by companies to spy on users , and offered broad legal immunity for disclosing the information obtained with the government .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sometimes they even granted companies the ability to 'hack back' ... a perfect storm threatening our online privacy."" The President's alternative bill is a bit less sweeping, but not by much .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, Congress and Obama seem to be finally on the same page about something: harsher penalties that won't reach the hackers they were worried about and invasive ""info-sharing"" that doesn't come close to solving existing problems .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"God forbid there be a full rebirth of the US-UK relationship , or that both sides of the Atlantic seek a full, two-state ban on encryption .",other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Rather disturbingly, one word seems to connect the activity of the Paris terrorists and that of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists: iconoclasm .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I say disturbingly , because pointing out some common ground may be seen as blurring the crucial distinction between murderous bastards and innocent satirists .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nonetheless ,  it strikes me as fascinating that the cartoonists were profoundly iconoclastic in their constant ridiculing of religion (all religions, it must be noted) - yet it is precisely this same ancient tradition of iconoclasm that inspires Jews and Muslims to resist representational art and, in its most twisted pathological form, to attack the offices of a Paris magazine and slaughter those whose only weapon was the pen .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So what's the connection?  In one sense an iconoclast is someone who refuses the established view of things , who kicks out against cherished beliefs and institutions .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which sounds pretty much like Charlie Hebdo .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the word iconoclast also describes those religious people who refuse and smash representational images , especially of the divine .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The second of the Ten Commandments prohibits graven images  - which is why there are no pictures of God in Judaism or Islam .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And theologically speaking, the reason they are deeply suspicious of divine representation is because they fear that such representations of God might get confused for the real thing .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The danger , they believe , is that we might end up overinvesting in a bad copy, something that looks a lot like what we might think of as god , but which, in reality, is just a human projection .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"And in taking the piss out of such images , they actually exist in a tradition of religious iconoclasts going back as far as Abraham taking a hammer to his father's statues .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both are attacks on representations of the divine .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Which is why the terrorists, as well as being murderers, are theologically mistaken in thinking Charlie Hebdo is the enemy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For if God is fundamentally unrepresentable , then any representation of God is necessarily less than God and thus deserves to be fully and fearlessly attacked .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And what better way of doing this than through satire , like scribbling a little moustache on a grand statue of God .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's only some Christians that might demur from this logic .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the Christian story (ie Christmas) tells of God coming into the world as a human being .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And in doing this the divine takes on a representational form .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jesus , says St Paul , is the image of the invisible God .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Without this the whole western tradition of Catholic religious art and eastern tradition of icons is utterly inconceivable .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I can see how some Christians might find disrespectful images of God a la Charlie Hebdo insulting .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After all ,  they believe it's possible for images genuinely to capture something of God .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But if images can't capture God - and that's the Jewish/Islamic position - then bring on the cartoonists .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They should be encouraged to do their worst and disrupt our confidence that what we think of as God bears any resemblance to anything legitimately God-like .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are like Moses bringing down the golden calf .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is the ancient job of the iconoclast .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But ,  of course, these terrorists weren't really interested in theology .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They thought that Charlie Hebdo's cartoonists were insulting their human tribe, a tribe they called fellow Muslims .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And maybe they were .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But whatever else was happening , it was the atheist cartoonists who were performing the religious function and the apparently believing Muslims who had forgotten their deepest religious insights .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For any representation of the divine that leads people to murder each other deserves the maximum possible disrespect .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In Ferguson, Missouri, 50 of the 53 police officers are white in a city that is two-thirds African American .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Connecticut's state capital , Hartford, 66% of the police department is white but only 16% of the residents are .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And these are just two examples: despite progress over the past 50 years , many police departments remain predominantly white in cities and towns where the majority of the population is nonwhite .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are some important exceptions to the disparity pattern .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Several big city police departments are majority-black or majority-Hispanic (Atlanta, Birmingham, Detroit, Washington, Miami, Santa Fe and El Paso, for instance) , while others (such as Chicago) are so diverse that no single group comprises the majority .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet for many other cities, the gap between the complexion of the police department and the local population is huge .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why does this matter? Do police officers of different racial and ethnic backgrounds act differently while on the job? Do they have different kinds of relationships with minority communities? Aren't all officers trained to do their jobs similarly and to treat all civilians the same regardless of race?  Research shows that, in general in the US, there is not a strong correlation, let alone a causal relationship, between an officer's race and how officers treat members of the public when they respond to calls from civilians or stop and question them on the streets Statistics are, of course, not predictive of individual behavior , and studies of specific departments or communities vary .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A 2004 study in Indianapolis (Indiana) and St  Petersburg (Florida) by Ivan Sun and Brian Payne, for example, found that black officers were more likely than white officers working in black neighborhoods to provide information, referrals to other agencies, and to treat residents respectfully , although the black officers were also more likely to use physical force against citizens in conflict situations .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But ,  again, most studies find similarities overall in police behavior irrespective of officers' racial background .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shared training in the academy, as well as on-the-job socialization by fellow officers, results in more similarities than differences among officers when it comes to their policing activities , including similarities in how officers of all races treat white versus non-white citizens .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So we should not view racial diversification on the force as a panacea for improving police treatment of minorities : instead if minority officers adopt majority attitudes about those they serve and protect , it might hardly help at all .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A 2008 study in Baltimore, Maryland by Peter Moskos documented precisely this shared mentality among both white and black officers .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it can pay major dividends in other ways .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In one poll of 1,791 Americans that I and a colleague conducted for our book, Race and Policing in America , more than 70% of blacks, Hispanics and whites in the United States believed that a city's police department should have a similar racial composition to the city .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The same study found that very few blacks and Hispanics (only 5%) want most officers who work in their neighborhoods to be exclusively of the same race as the residents , and instead most people prefer to see racially - mixed teams of officers patrolling their streets .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
". Importantly, such diversity can help to build trust and confidence in the police : the more a police department reflects the composition of the local population , the higher the department's reputation among residents , which can provide a foundation to build further trust , coupled with other needed reforms .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It also helps, in majority-black or majority-Hispanic cities , if the chief of police comes from that community as well because, as the public face of the department , he or she can allay suspicions when controversial incidents occur in a way that white police chiefs may not be able to do .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A diverse police force can also help to decrease the sense that individuals are being stopped and questioned solely because of their race .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This clearly applies when the officers and citizens are of the same race , but even encounters between white officers and minority citizens may be perceived as less racialized when the department has a critical mass of minority officers .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A representative police force can, in other words, have symbolic benefits that enhance the overall status of a police department and also reduce the perception that actions, such as stops or searches, are based on racial profiling .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most police chiefs realize the advantages of a department that represents the local community , but there are big challenges in recruiting more minority officers .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many Hispanics and African Americans are reluctant to consider a career in law enforcement - not surprising, given the history of policing in America coupled with more recent events .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Highly-publicized incidents like the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in New York only make it more difficult for police departments to recruit minority officers .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Recruiters can have some success , however , if they broaden their outreach efforts to include churches and community centers - and if there are pre- existing positive relationships between the police and residents in those minority neighborhoods where community policing has already taken root , which can be built on .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although troubled interactions between minorities and police garner most of the headlines , there are neighborhoods in American cities where working-class and middle-class black and Hispanic residents - including youths - have better relationships with the authorities than on average , as I found in a study of Washington DC neighborhoods .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is in these communities that the police can enhance their recruitment efforts and achieve at least some success .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Possibly the most specious argument against the California ban came from the plaintiffs' lawyer, Michael Tenenbaum , who called the ruling "" a victory for freedom.""

The first thing to say about the collapse of Circle's pioneering contract to manage Hinchingbrooke district hospital in Cambridgeshire is that it must be desperately worrying for patients and staff alike .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even though the Care Quality Commission found that the hospital was ""inadequate"" across the board, including care and safety - which probably precipitated Circle's decision to pull out - uncertainty allied with ill health is a terrible combination .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NHS England, and the Department of Health, have a heavy burden of responsibility over the coming days to restore confidence and clarify what happens next .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The second point is that it is a political catastrophe for the Conservatives  - although the process of privatisation began on Labour's watch - all the worse for coinciding with ever grimmer news on waiting times at accident and emergency departments in England .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cost and disruption of the Lansley reforms must bear some responsibility for the worst winter crisis ever .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hinchingbrooke's failure surely torpedoes any immediate prospects of a big expansion of privatisation .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It looks like a clear victory for all those who have repeatedly warned that privatisation and profits are incompatible with a free, universal healthcare system .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It could be Tweeted as Goldman Sachs (training ground of Ali Parsa, Circle's former chief executive), nil, NHS, one .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The truth is more complex .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Circle won the contract in a process of franchising out Hinchingbrooke hospital management at least partly because no NHS bidder thought the sums could be made to add up .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hinchingbrooke , which sits almost equidistant between major hospitals in Cambridge to the south and Peterborough to the north , is a hospital that has needed downsizing or even closing for the last 20 years .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now Circle is pulling out , less than a third of the way through a 10-year contract, reportedly ? 7m poorer and with a stock price that has taken a double-digit hit in the past 24 hours , surely confirmation that privatisation delivers no magical solution .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Circle's obligations included paying down a debt of ? 40m, accrued over just three years, within the next 10 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The heroic scale of that commitment was laid bare in a National Audit Office report in 2013 , which showed that Circle would have to deliver ? 30m of savings every year .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Only months after the start of the contract in February 2012, it was clear the hospital was well behind its savings target .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although care improved , it was clear the financial plan wasn't working .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr Parsa stood down as chief executive of Circle .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By the end of its second financial year, the deficit was just short of ? 5m, the point at which Circle could pull out .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MPs on the public accounts committee have questioned how the contract came to be awarded at all .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Part of the answer is that it was clear an NHS solution was not on the cards : it would have taken more cash than was available post-crash .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But there's a lesson in the way contracts are awarded too .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At least one study suggests a lack of expertise in Whitehall means that contracts go to the shiniest rather than the most competent contender .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Circle complains that it wasn't in control of the environment in which it worked .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like every hospital trust, it struggled under new treatment tariffs , the Nicholson challenge to make ? 20bn of savings over a five-year period, and fluctuating demand influenced partly by GP and community care availability .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Lansley reforms have set up a competitive relationship between the new care commissioning groups and providers such as Hinchingbrooke, unforeseen when the contract was agreed .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The process of winding up the Circle franchise and bringing the hospital back into NHS management will lay bare the weaknesses of the new structures, the lack of any proper local accountability and the inability to reorganise services on a coherent, holistic basis .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The impact of complexity, centralisation and cost-cutting are now graven on the statistics .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The figures published today show that every aspect of A&E; care - not just waiting times, but delayed ambulances, ambulances waiting to transfer patients , and patients waiting to be transferred out of A&E ; - are the worst on record .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Better coordination is undoubtedly needed to foil further attacks in Europe , where Islamist terrorists have struck in three capitals - Madrid, London and now Paris .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anti-terrorism raids in France and Belgium confirm that the threat continues .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Paris killers had links with networks across the Middle East, including in Yemen .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the need to share intelligence to counter groups that themselves operate and communicate easily across borders cannot be disputed .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A further illustration of this came when an Algerian national appeared before a Greek prosecutor on Monday over a possible link to a foiled Islamist plot to attack police in Belgium .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It is, nevertheless, vital that such cooperation avoids the mistakes of the past .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not a war of civilisations .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is a fight against a violent sectarian ideology that finds breeding grounds in Europe's disenfranchised communities and in the killing fields of the Middle East .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ms Mogherini is correct to state that this is ""not an issue between Europe or the west and Islam"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Others are run by despots or by military juntas, as in Egypt, or have been caught in a spiral of anarchy, as in Libya .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Human rights activists and civil society struggle to do their work under immense pressure .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are few checks and balances .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nor is there sufficient oversight of security forces conducting anti-terrorism efforts .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"An alliance with authoritarian powers, made blindly or naively , can too easily involve the abandonment of values, a dangerous sense of impunity and even indifference towards the worst abuses .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their disappearance is a recognition that ways of seeing are changing .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It may seem misjudged to herald the disappearance of the Page 3 girl as a victory when pornography is probably more easily available than at any time in history .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet this is a fight that will be won skirmish by skirmish , and the fight against Page 3 has been more than a skirmish .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It matters because this is not some small elitist publication but Britain's biggest-selling newspaper .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It matters because it was made to matter through the efforts of brave and resolute women like Clare Short and Harriet Harman , campaigning unflinchingly through 40 long years of sneering and jeering to make people see why it is an outrage in a society that purports to believe in equality between the sexes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It matters because - even when it is subsitituted , as the Sun intends , with more images of airbrushed beauty - it is a reminder to girls worrying about the gap between their own body and some version of perfection that there is an alternative view .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It matters because it means that it is now generally recognised that pictures objectifying women  - even when she is a willing partner in the objectification - are demeaning and damaging to wider society .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How much damage the great oil crash will do here depends what happens next .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the past, the world has been stunned not only by the waning but also the waxing of the price .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If what comes down soon goes back up , such direct effects may not prove so profound .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What will matter more in the longer term is the dynamic effect on the energy infrastructure .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For both good and ill, cheap oil disincentivises investment in change .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the plus side, the most exploitative schemes to extract ever more fossil fuels become less economic .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Already, oil companies are reviewing a planned $1 trillion in ventures, such as deep-sea drilling , that no longer make economic sense .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If oil's depression continues , marginal fracking projects could be extinguished .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All this is helpful in terms of the burning question about how the world can agree to leave half of its coal, gas and oil underground , as it will have to if the world is to keep a lid on the warming .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But at the same time cheap oil weakens market forces that might otherwise rein in energy use .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The expectation that fossil fuels would get scarcer and pricier has forced capitalism to take investment in energy efficiency seriously .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Manufacturers of electric cars and green fridges could get cold feet , and there could likewise be an unravelling of the logic of developing renewable energy , which only stacks up when the power that it generates is less costly than carbon-based energy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"With Mr Cameron, the reverse is true .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He has charm and a certain decency , but he is too easily blown off course by adverse winds arising within his own party and outside it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This has led him to take positions on Europe and immigration that could have been expressly designed to reduce our influence on our neighbours, ones that could lead to Britain departing the European Union .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That would leave the United Kingdom in an isolation which it can be guessed Mr Cameron does not want but which he could nevertheless end up having brought about .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So it is that , as our former Berlin correspondent argues , he looks to Germany for rescue, hoping that Mrs Merkel's government will help craft changes in European regulations that Mr Cameron will then be able to present to his own party and to voters attracted by Ukip's nostrums as helping Britain control the flow of immigrants .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whether such changes actually would have that effect in any longer term is another matter .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She is hardly beyond reproach .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Her austerity drive can be said, at the very least , to be causing as many problems as it solves .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Her insistence on reform in Greece is vague when it should be detailed , leading to the suspicion that the problem is that, in German eyes, Greece can do nothing right .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Domestically, she often manages to ""solve"" political problems by simply sitting them out , while her parliamentarians squabble and everyone gets bored of the subject and moves on .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is how she dealt with the scandal of the NSA monitoring her mobile phone : she largely kept quiet when many were hoping that she would raise her voice more loudly .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The director-general whispered sweet reason .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He emphasised the oversight the agency faces, and rejected , he said , the lazy insistence that more security had to mean less privacy .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Such pinpointed (and legally controlled) intelligence work might, perhaps, also have made a difference in Paris , where both the Charlie Hebdo murderers were on watchlists .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mr Parker, however, lurched from detailing such targeted work to making oblique allusions to the entirely sweeping, and until 2013 entirely unacknowledged, probing of communication records, and the interference with internet traffic on the often-spurious pretext that it is ""international"" in a purely technical sense .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These are the practices that give the state such chilling potential to keep exhaustive tabs on so many citizens .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In conjunction with the joint military action against Islamic State (Isis), Tony Abbott has pledged $5m in humanitarian aid for Iraq on his recent surprise visit to Baghdad .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But don't be fooled by the government's apparent show of generosity - Australia isn't giving any more to foreign aid than it was before .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  it is giving significantly less .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is vitally important that we don't stop talking about recent cuts to foreign aid .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The government's mid-year economic and fiscal outlook has reduced the foreign aid budget to the lowest levels in Australian history .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Foreign aid spending has been cut by almost $3.7bn over four years .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to the $7.6bn already cut in May's federal budget, foreign aid has been cut by one quarter .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If the government is serious about tackling terrorist threats and defending ""universal values"" , cutting off foreign aid to programmes that provide education, reduce poverty and improve gender equality is one of the worst ways to go about it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Save Australian Aid campaign states that $11bn in foreign aid - the amount cut from the foreign aid budget in the past year - is the equivalent of 2 million children who may not be able to enrol in school, 1.4 million births without a birth attendant, 3.7 million children who may not receive vaccinations , 4.7 million people who will have reduced access to safe water , and almost 22 million people with reduced assistance in emergency situations .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These cuts further perpetuate the idea that Australia is not a team player , a notion fuelled by our past behaviour towards our neighbours, and our recent denials of international obligations towards asylum seekers and climate change .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to the cuts in the Myefo, Australia backed out of commitments made to tax justice in the recent G20 summit .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is estimated that developing nations lose $160bn per year to corporate tax dodging; an amount that would end world hunger three times over .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The G20 commitment, Abbott said, was ""about the countries of the world, the people of the world, receiving the tax benefits that are their due and it's needed so that governments can fund the infrastructure and the services that people expect and deserve."" As the host of the G20 , backing out of this commitment not only damages our international credibility, but also has a huge impact on the developing world .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The foreign aid cuts are irresponsible, but not surprising .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cutting the aid budget sends a clear message to our developing neighbours that Australia won't lend a helping hand unless it's in our own best interest .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  our politicians seem to forget that there is something in it for us, and not only in Iraq .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aid is much more than a humanitarian gesture ; it's a tool for regional development, trust and cooperation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Foreign aid programmes promote stability through education and equality, in turn reducing conflict .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As an added bonus, foreign aid and sustainable development programmes create stronger economies , which in turn create opportunities at home and abroad .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Poverty breeds hopelessness and despair , which are both contributing factors to extremist behaviour .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Foreign aid is not the only factor in answering this issue , but it's more than a step in the right direction .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Higher levels of foreign aid have the potential not to only alleviate extreme poverty in our region, but to raise international opinion of Australia as a fair country .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A recent study examining the effects of foreign aid on foreign public opinion found that US aid programmes targeting HIV/Aids have improved perceptions of the US among the public in recipient countries .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Australia would reap these benefits as a side effect of foreign aid , saving the millions of dollars set aside to ""stop the boats"" and wage a ""war on terror"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But our government has, predictably, made yet another irresponsible decision with untold repercussions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While two innocent people died in Martin Place on 16 December in what has been labelled an act of terror , a reduction of this size in the foreign aid budget will result in the unnecessary deaths of hundreds across the globe due to reduced access to vital services .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The high priority the Abbott government has placed on security doesn't come cheap, with funds for anti-terrorism programmes costing billions of dollars .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wouldn't this money be better spent reducing inequality, poverty, and conflict? Shouldn't we be stopping the problem at the source, not trying to cure the symptoms?",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Listen to the doomsayers, the scaremongers and the Farage brigade , and you would be forgiven for thinking that London is full .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our capital , just like our country, they say , can't cope with any more people .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything from traffic jams to NHS waiting times is blamed on immigrants .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The only answer , they tell us , is to pull up the drawbridge and close our borders , turning our back on the globalised world that this country did so much to create .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How, then , do they explain the fact that, according to forecasts, only today will London's population surpass that of 1939  - topping 8.6 million for the first time? It is a stark rebuttal of the frequently peddled myth that says London must stop growing .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead of the huge influx of immigrants that headlines wrongly report, in reality the capital's population has only gradually been creeping back to the level of 75 years ago , before the blitz destroyed many parts of the city .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today, though, shows more than just the falsity of the immigration scare stories - it highlights the huge success of London as a city .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our capital continues to attract people from all over the country and all over the globe because of the opportunities it offers : to find work, set down roots, enjoy a world-class cultural scene and be accepted regardless of who you are and where you come from .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That success should be a cause of great celebration, not something to curse and try to curtail .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But no one should deny the pressures that come with a growing population - pressures that are particularly acute in the capital .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"London is in the midst of the deepest housing crisis in decades , as average house prices soar to 14 times the average salary and rents rise uncontrollably .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The city's transport system is struggling to cope with demand , with commuters crammed into conditions in which it would be illegal to transport livestock , and fares rising year on year .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The opportunities to get a decent job, buy a house, and enjoy all the city has to offer are becoming fewer .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The reality is becoming detached from the dream .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These problems arise not because of growing demand alone but because of the failure of political leaders to respond to it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Londoners have a right to expect more from their mayor than the 17,000 new homes that were built in the capital last year - less than a third of the 63,000 a year that are needed to solve the city's housing crisis .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That Boris Johnson has missed his own affordable housing targets in every year of his mayoralty is an abject failure of political leadership .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The government's unwillingness to commit to vital transport infrastructure, such as Crossrail 2 and new Thames bridges , is scarcely better .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
History shows us what can be achieved when politicians take population growth seriously and rise to the challenges it creates .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the midst of the second world war , even as bombs fell and the city burned , a plan was devised to respond to London's growth .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Abercrombie plan, officially called the Greater London plan, laid out an ambitious vision for a new postwar London: decent housing replacing slums, efficient transport, full employment, new parks and open spaces .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was a radical and comprehensive document that provided the detail for rebuilding London after the devastation of the war .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New towns including Stevenage and Crawley were built in the south-east ; modern transport infrastructure, including the north and south circular roads, was planned to cope with the increasing number of cars .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The requirements of a successful London were drawn up and implemented .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A growing population and new pressures on services mean we need a new, equally ambitious plan today .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Empty words about more homes and better jobs will not cut it ; they are no substitute for a serious and detailed proposal for building at least 63,000 homes a year and rebalancing the city's economy to create jobs and opportunities for Londoners while continuing to invest in the industries of tomorrow .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The city's creaking transport system must be upgraded, with Crossrail 2 and other new infrastructure built .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This must happen without the continuous and excessive raising of fares , which burns holes in Londoners' pockets .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Keeping London affordable for ordinary people must be central to the plan, and improving the quality of life of Londoners a core theme .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given that London successfully adapted to growing demands in the middle of a world war , we can be optimistic about our chances of doing the same today .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We should not let those with a political agenda use London's growing population to support their anti-immigration rhetoric , and we should challenge those who want to label London's global attraction a flaw rather than a strength .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That our capital is back at its peak population is a sign of its success as a great global city .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"People from all corners of the globe still take great risks, at great expense , to become Londoners and to benefit from the city's opportunities .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But this isn't a time for complacency .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whoever the next mayor is , they must focus their gaze on solving the problems that stem from growing demand on London's infrastructure .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As population continues towards 10 million , we need a new plan to take London forward together according to the qualities of the city at its best : inclusive, diverse, ambitious, forward-looking and offering a wealth of opportunities to all who live here .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mahan in Madhya Pradesh is one of the oldest and largest sal forests in Asia .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The local communities are dependent on the forest for their livelihoods and it is also home to several rare and endangered species .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But a portion of this reserve is earmarked for open cast coal mining by Essar, a British company registered in London .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to mine for coal, they would need to cut down the forest and displace those who live there .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Essar would destroy more than 1,000 hectares of pristine forests and the biodiversity that it supports , affecting 54 villages .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It would also impact on the livelihoods of thousands more who depend on forest produce , and the wildlife, water and air in the region .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For the last three years I have been helping villagers in Mahan to assert their rights, protect their forest, and prevent the open-cast coalmine development .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unfortunately, during this time, I have experienced a wide range of intimidation tactics .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have received anonymous phone calls threatening violence and been followed by a car without a number plate as I travelled to village meetings .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last year I discovered that a forged letter bearing my signature had been given to local media .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It called on villagers to resort to violence while protesting against the mine .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And Greenpeace India is currently appealing against a decision by the home ministry to freeze all its overseas funding, some 40% of its income .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But Sunday marked a new low .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was due to travel to London to address British parliamentarians about my work with local Mahan communities , but I was not allowed to board my flight despite having valid travel documents .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My passport was stamped with ""offloaded"" at the airport and I was asked to go home .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only explanation offered was that this was being done by the orders of the government of India .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since then, I have consulted lawyers and written to government agencies .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I've had no official response , but some newspapers reported that I have been put on a ""blacklist"" or ""lookout list"" preventing me from leaving the country .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Such lists are usually for those with criminal convictions and I don't have one .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Refusing my travel to speak to British MPs with no legal reason to do so is an infringement on my fundamental rights, and a shocking blow to the strength and freedom of civil society in India .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My travel was legitimate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Essar is based in London and I was invited by a British all-party parliamentary group to talk about my work and to present the social and environmental impacts of the project - otherwise known as freedom of speech .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are equally engaged with all major parties and relevant politicians and administrators in India on this issue .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fight in Mahan is about the rights of those people who live there and depend on the forest for their livelihoods .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The local community is only asking that due process is followed : under Indian law there must be a local referendum and consent from the local community .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But these laws have been bypassed , and now the government is reviewing major environmental laws, including the Forest Rights Act , that have been key in protecting forest dwellers .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is why a fight such as Mahan in India is critical .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's symptomatic of how India will act when it comes to making important decisions about forests, conservation, community rights and a sustainable way of development .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The act of engaging all relevant stakeholders is part of my work as a Greenpeace member and indeed the responsibility of any vibrant civil society in any functional democracy .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Travelling to London to meet British MPs was neither an attack on the Indian government, nor a violation of the laws of our country .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Internationally, India is under a lot of pressure to make strong commitments to tackling climate change , yet it is drawn to the cheap and immediate gains of coal despite the high social and environmental cost .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Groups such as Greenpeace are a vital check on the power of corporations and politicians .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We fight for Indian values promoting empowered local communities and a clean environment for the next generation .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And our campaigns, such as the push to get pesticides out of our tea , have been successful .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's why we're being attacked .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a week's time, Greenpeace India will find out if its appeal against the Indian government freezing its funding is successful .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If not , other campaign groups will be next .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whatever the outcome , I will continue to support the rights of communities using all the democratic rights available to me .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will also continue to seek answers as to why I was blacklisted .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The online world is fertile ground for these .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tumblr, Twitter and 4chan, for example, are full of young people pledging fervent allegiance to a favorite fan culture, a political movement or a self-diagnosis, with all the rights, privileges, and rivalries that implies .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Building a self-concept means staking your claim for an audience, however small .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm sure kids still write private stuff .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But there can also be pitfalls .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sometimes , when you're trying to figure out who you are and what you believe , you test out a lot of convictions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(I had an ""I hate feminists because they get mad when men hold doors for them"" phase, for example .)

"You've pledged allegiance , and everyone saw you do it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now , when someone challenges you , you have to double down .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The danger of overcommitting to passing thoughts by making them public isn't just a pitfall for teens .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Adults do it all the time  - they make an offhanded comment and then make it worse with a defensive non-apology, or complain about an offhanded comment and set off the outrage machine .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the teen years are an identities factory , churning out new products right and left .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You try out more opinions and self-concepts , and you're much more susceptible to peer pressure .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's perfect lab conditions for getting locked into an idea of yourself that would have otherwise been ephemeral .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not saying we should keep teenagers off the internet .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Teens are the internet's beating heart , and they always have been ; an internet without teens doesn't bear thinking about .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Besides ,  young people who are marginalized, or confused, or in any way lonely need to see that there is a whole world they can connect to - that there are people who share their problems , or maybe that their idiosyncrasies aren't problems at all .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In an ideal world we'd keep adults off the internet instead , to preserve it as a space of identity experimentation for the people who really need that .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Anyway , they're certainly political allies - or at least were, before Gove made his ill-judged remark about the ""preposterous"" number of the prime minister's coterie who went to Eton , which ironically led Cameron to lose faith in about the only one who didn't , Gove himself .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""That's what you get,"" the PM must have muttered to himself , ""for trusting oiks.""  Since then Gove's slide down the greasy pole could hardly have been less dignified if he'd been wearing nipple tassels .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our attitudes to accidental phone rings are stuck in the 80s .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mal was a member of a then-notorious neo-Nazi organisation with a track record of serious criminal activity .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He regularly turned up at whatever suburban park or abandoned house we found ourselves in as we sought to consume drugs and booze away from prying eyes .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Since we were always heavily intoxicated, more often than not our victims survived the attacks in far better shape than we did .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unlike today , when a disenfranchised youth has a raft of violent ideologies to be swept up in , it was then my pure fortune that my only real option for extremist activity was this poorly led group .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ongoing action by Asio and the now-defunct special branch of the NSW police and, mostly, the self-implosion of key individuals in the group , meant that by the time I joined it was only a shadow of its former strength .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thanks to strong family support together with professional help, I was able to leave the group and its racist ideology well behind .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was eventually diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following a case of long-term bullying at school .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While that has helped me understand what drove me to this group , it is clear that all the factors that leave a young person susceptible to extremist ideology - poverty, lack of education, inadequate mental health support services and general social exclusion - still widely exist across western nations .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I cringe when I hear our political leadership deliver yet another speech extolling a commitment to fighting extremism , yet in almost the time it takes to draw their next breath , go on to announce cuts to community services groups, the kind of organisations whose roles are vital in addressing the risk factors that leave one vulnerable to extremism .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's not that Orwell was completely off the mark when he said ""people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The clear and present danger today , as events from Oklahoma City through most recently to Paris have shown , is that the biggest threats are of the home-grown variety .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris last week, many people in France and elsewhere have declared, Je suis Charlie (""I am Charlie"") after heavily armed gunmen broke into the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical French magazine, and killed eight staff members, two police officers, a building maintenance worker and wounded several others .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people including a number of world leaders such as Angela Merkel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and David Cameron gathered in Paris for a unity rally , to stand in mourning, in defiance .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There were cries of Je suis Charlie, Je suis Ahmed (I am Ahmed, the Muslim police officer who lost his life in the attack) , Je suis juif (I am a Jew) .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These declarations were a display of solidarity with those who lost their lives and those who survived .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They allowed people to try and place themselves in the lives of others by using the power of language .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have seen this kind of remembrance before in the face of tragedy : I am Troy Davis ; I am Mike Brown ; I am Eric Garner ; I am Renisha McBride .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But we are none of these people .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We can and do empathize with the plights of the dead, the survivors and their loved ones .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We can and do empathize with how fragile we all are , and with how we cannot be ruled by terror, but why the rhetorical urge to take the place of the fallen? What does it bring them? I, too, have ached since hearing the news of what happened in Paris but je ne suis pas Charlie et je ne suis pas Ahmed et je ne suis pas juif .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are times when silence equals consent, but is the loss of someone else's life really such an instance? Is it reasonable to assume that if je ne suis pas Charlie , I tacitly endorse terrorism?  I believe in the freedom of expression, unequivocally - though , as I have written before , I wish more people would understand that freedom of expression is not freedom from consequence .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I find some of the work of Charlie Hebdo distasteful , because there is a preponderance of bigotry of all kinds in many of their cartoons' sentiments .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Still ,  my distaste should not dictate the work the magazine produces or anything else .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo - and writers and artists everywhere - should be able to express themselves and challenge authority without being murdered .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Murder is not an acceptable consequence for anything .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet it is also an exercise of freedom of expression to express offense at the way satire like Charlie Hebdo's characterizes something you hold dear - like your faith, your personhood, your gender, your sexuality, your race or ethnicity .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Demands for solidarity can quickly turn into demands for groupthink , making it difficult to express nuance .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It puts the terms of our understanding of the situation in black and white - you are either with us or against us - instead of allowing people to mourn and be angry while also being sympathetic to complexities that are being overlooked .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has been disheartening to see calls for the Muslim community to denounce terrorism .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It has been disheartening to see journalists highlighting the stories of ""good"" Muslims , as if goodness is the exception to the rule of an entire people .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We will continue to see discussions of satire, the freedom of expression and its limits .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will see speculations as to how such a tragedy can be avoided because it is easier to speculate than it is to accept that we cannot prevent terrorism .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We cannot sway extremists with rational thought or with our ideas of right and wrong .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Life moves quickly but , sometimes, consideration does not .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And yet ,  we insist that people provide an immediate response, or immediate agreement, a universal, immediate me-too  - as though we don't want people to pause at all , to consider what they are weighing in on .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We don't want to complicate our sorrow or outrage when it is easier to experience these emotions in their simplest, purest states .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The older (and hopefully wiser) I get , the more I want to pause .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want to take the time to think through how I feel and why I feel .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't want to feign expertise on matters I know nothing about for the purpose of offering someone else my immediate reaction for their consumption .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The demand for response from all of us through the means available to us, most often our social networks, rises in part because we can feel so impotent in our day-to-day lives .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are people with jobs and families and our quotidian concerns .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is easy to feel impotent in the face of terrorism in Paris or hundreds of girls being kidnapped in Nigeria or a bombing at an NAACP building in Colorado or an unarmed black man being killed by a police officer .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Within our social networks, we can feel less alone .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can feel less impotent .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can make these gestures of solidarity .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Je suis Charlie .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can change our avatars .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We can share our anger, our fear, or devastation without having to face that we may not be able to do much more .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But we still feel impotent and we still feel inadequate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we see people not participating in our expressions of solidarity -- not showing their awareness of their own impotence -- we see something we can possibly change .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is why we demand allegiance .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In dark days , the heart cleaves disproportionately to Lilliputian scraps of good news and so it was that as events played out in Paris last week , I kept thinking of the writer Joan Didion, the star of Celine's latest ad campaign, tiny in black , her porcelain face half obscured by sunglasses as big and as inky as the dinner plates in the kind of restaurants frequented by Patrick Bateman in American Psycho .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh, the brilliance of Didion! I like to think of myself as wholly resistant to the wicked wiles of big fashion , but this campaign seemed somehow to have got through , and I was all aflutter .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What , I wondered , was the provenance of the socking great pendant that hung about her neck in Juergen Teller's photograph? Was it by Celine or was it , as they say , model's own? Could I find something similar on eBay? All day long, between work and news bulletins, I restlessly Googled various combinations of the words ""buy"", ""vintage"", ""bronze"", ""large"" and ""locket"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The coverage of the Paris fashion house's decision to make the author of Slouching Towards Bethlehem, The White Album and The Year of Magical Thinking its new face has focused mostly on her age .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Didion is 80 ; when she began her career as a writer at American Vogue in the late 50s , the personnel director of the magazine's owner, Conde Nast, would from time to time stop her in the hall and ask her when she had last called her mother .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Apparently, we should celebrate Teller's photograph of her as a particularly exalted example of fashion's increased willingness to embrace models with wrinkles, liver spots and histories that trail all the way back to the days when women still wore white gloves and little hats to work .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At last , the thinking goes , fashion has realised that beauty may also come with silver hair .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What? You don't buy that? Well, then .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Think of it this way .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At least it seems finally to have grasped that women don't simply give up shopping the moment they turn 50 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it's not Didion's age that interests me .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's her status as a writer and thinker .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By choosing her - acclaimed and bestselling, but also trenchant, highly mannered and somewhat complicated - Celine's creative director, Phoebe Philo, is sending out quite a bracing message , even if the semaphore in which it's written will, alas, be largely illegible to those who know nothing of Didion .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There' s something going on beyond the cunning commercial appeal to the kind of conflicted consumer who values the inner life as much as the outer  - I mean the kind of woman whose ""buttery"" leather tote must be big enough to contain at least one hardback if it is not to make her feel guilty for the rest of her life .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Isn't this campaign also in the business of suggesting that to be clever and a touch difficult (Didion is nothing if not unpredictable) is to be timelessly beautiful? That this is, in fact, a state to which women might like to aspire? Oh, Phoebe! If only I could afford your gorgeous, minimalist gear , I would dash out and buy something right now just to say thank you .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And yet how often have I chickened out? How often do I try, even now , to wear pretty clothes, fun clothes, to embrace colour and print and embroidery? To toddle along in shoes in which I cannot run or even , if I'm honest , walk? Like most professional women who are neither beautiful nor willing to play dumb all of the time , I fear being thought ugly or uncompromising or seeming as if I have not made an effort .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I fear , if you will , being seen to be picking a fight , whether by the way I speak or the way I dress .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I guess you could say that I wear the swishy frock and high heels the better that I might be allowed, sometimes , to speak my mind .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I adore the way that Didion, half child and half sphinx, thinner than a cigarette, looks .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But she is not, and never has been , classically beautiful .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nor is she willing to play the fool .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She is discreet, but never decorous ; she is fierce, preternaturally observant and, sometimes, a little self-obsessed .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And her clothes - unfussy, elegant, practical, a touch forbidding - reflect this .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What Teller's photograph says to me is: approach with caution ; subject may bite .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I love the continuity in this, the wholeness, the confidence in the way that the clothes are an extension of the personality - and I salute Phoebe Philo for recognising it , for extolling it to the world as worthy of admiration , as a thing to be replicated by those women who have the pluck, if not exactly the hard cash .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are mobilizing a resistance that could prove to be the game changer in the fight to stop the proposed Keystone XL pipeline and help shut down the tar sand projects in northern Alberta .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our resistance to the Keystone XL pipeline and other tar sand infrastructure is grounded in our inherent right to self-determination as indigenous peoples .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This pipeline will leak , it will contaminate the water .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The lack of proper consultation with tribal nations along the proposed route of the Keystone XL pipeline violates basic tenets of US Federal Indian Law and the principle of free, prior and informed consent recognized in international law .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I applaud President Obama's decision to veto any Congressional Keystone XL bill , but I also encourage him to respect indigenous people's self- determination and our need to protect Mother Earth by rejecting the presidential permit for the KXL pipeline, too .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I urge our allies to stand with Native people, heed our call for systemic change to how we create and utilize energy and the policies that regulate both , support our right to self-determination, and join our movement to protect the territorial integrity and sacredness of Mother Earth .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reject the Keystone XL pipeline .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"There' s only thing duller than a Twitterstorm , and that's an Instagramstorm .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Really, the only dignified thing to do is to not dignify it with a response, and move on .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Who cares if Madonna straps black ropes on the images of dead black rights icons? As Peter Robinson wrote in the Guardian : ""It's slightly heartbreaking that Madonna, an artist who made her name through an intuitive grasp of almost every major trend and zeitgeist fluctuation , is so crap at social media.""  But sometimes a solely jaded response betrays our own complacency, like resigning yourself to the fact that there will always be people who think of racist slurs as banter , or those who think it is just fine to appropriate the symbols of others to give their own tepid existence some edge , or people who still wear bootcut jeans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's not OK , no matter how persistent and ever - present it is .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even though Madonna has always been controversial , it also seems that as the world around her has got sharper , she has got duller and more derivative .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The appropriation that she and others have carried out is nothing new ; we're just noticing it more .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's because those who are piggybacking on others' journeys do not only have more channels to flaunt their cluelessness and sense of entitlement (Iggy Azalea, walk away from Twitter) but they are also being called out on it more .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whether it is usurping religion - crucifixes and nun habits are passe now ; it's niqabs on naked bodies  - keep up - homosexuality or now minority rights , Madonna is a manifestation of how privilege feeds off the authenticity of ""struggle"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a double plundering that leads to further marginalisation : the dominant narrative will oppress you, then co-opt you, and then weave you into your own tiny little section of the tapestry .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some would argue that slavery and segregation ended long ago (well, segregation in the US in the 60s and apartheid in South African in the 90s, so not that long ago) .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But that doesn't mean white people can now happily vandalise the cultural and historical totems of a minority's struggle as part of some universal poster for the white western narrative of overcoming and learning from our mistakes .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Imagine a pop artist using the recent CIA torture as part of their campaign  - perhaps showing dead Arab personalities being waterboarded .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No? Too soon? Well , when it comes to certain issues , it will always too soon .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of course ,  the charitable position is that Madonna, or to a different extent, Iggy Azalea, are not doing this with any high degree of self-awareness or design - they might see all contemporary culture as equal-access human heritage that they can dip into and sample as a vehicle for their talent .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They would be right to some extent , but the sad fact is that these modern iterations of minority culture that they are sampling all arose from suffering and oppression rather than from a series of tortured geniuses in drawing rooms across Europe .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, there are spaces where our common mix of religious, sexual and racial legacies intermingle - gloriously , sometimes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now embarked on the longest general election campaign in the history of Britain .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even political obsessives quail at the thought .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I plead guilty to bringing a little genuine political debate into the process so early on in the process .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The issue is the new Scottish Labour leader, Jim Murphy, and his vainglorious boast that he is going to use mansion tax money from London and the south -east to pay for 1,000 new nurses in Scotland .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let me stress that I support the mansion tax in principle .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is a redistributive tax , which is important , and taxes on assets are always worth considering .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The complication is that it is, in effect, a tax on London, 80% of which will be paid by people in London and the south -east .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the distorted nature of London's housing market could mean a tax with wildly distorted effects .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No one really knows how much it will raise .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems likely that the people everyone agrees should pay it - the international super-wealthy - will use their expensive lawyers and accountants to evade it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But it will hit older Londoners, often public sector workers who bought houses in what were then unfashionable parts of London , as in my constituency, Hackney North and Stoke Newington .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now they are living in houses worth ? 1m and rising .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are often asset rich but cash poor .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Having seen London house prices spiral in value , they are not reassured by the idea that the mansion tax kicks in only at ? 2m .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the very least, a lot of work needs to be put in to reassure those voters, and to fashion a tax that will not hit those people unfairly .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fortunately the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has an open mind on the subject .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That is why it is surprising that Murphy has jumped in feet first , boasting about how he will spend money from a tax when there is no agreement on exactly how it will be levied .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I am a unionist , and I understand that the Labour party has a big electoral challenge in Scotland .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But I cannot believe that Scottish voters will be taken in by a crude attempt to buy their votes with money expropriated from London .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If Murphy is really interested in redistributing wealth , why isn't he talking about council tax revaluation or levels of income tax in Scotland? Instead he seeks cheap applause by telling the Scots how he will extract money from England .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Recently there has been a series of reports, including from the London Finance Commission and the Royal Society of Arts City Growth Commission, calling for the devolution of powers to our great cities .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In particular ,  experts are saying that big cities should be allowed to keep their property taxes - I believe that this process should start with the mansion tax .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Devolution cannot be for Scotland alone ; there should also be devolution of powers to the cities and regions .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Murphy cannot bully the rest of the UK about a considered devolution of fiscal powers to all our cities with a pre-emptive strike on the mansion tax .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is too easy to conflate London with bankers and the international glitterati .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But London is more unequal than any other part of Britain .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Child poverty is a third higher in London than the rest of England as a whole .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, general election campaign or not , we need a proper debate on devolution of powers to our great cities .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is part of the battle against the poverty that still exists in the shadow of the glittering towers of the City of London .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And some people need to be prepared to stand up for London in this important debate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I remember a time not so long ago when a marathon runner was a mythical beast - we all knew someone who knew someone who had run a marathon , but most of us had only ever seen these creatures on the TV in their emaciated, long-limbed flow .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But now everyone knows a marathon runner and they just look like normal people .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Somewhere along the way , marathons became commonplace and a whole new breed of extreme activities came along - the Ironman triathlon; multi-day cycle events like John O'Groats to Lands End; crazy ultra marathons like the Thames Path 100; and events that defy description like the Tough Mudder . While a lot of extreme challenges are to do with ultra endurance , the Tough Mudder is short but involves getting hurt . Sometimes by electric shocks . And fire .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What is wrong with you, Mudders?  I have no idea what caused the rise of the extreme sports as a phenomenon , but I do know what happened for me .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After many years of corporate life and general indolence I found myself resting a glass of champagne on a large belly, unable to get to the buffet without puffing .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Horrified at the realisation that I had become Mr Creosote from The Meaning of Life , I resolved immediately to sign up for the Great Edinburgh Run .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The GER was only 10k but it terrified me and filled me with doubts : what if I came last? Do I have to run all the way? Will I be the fattest dude on the course? Four months later I completed it easily .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then I signed up for a marathon .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And then an Ironman .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And this is the thing - every step of the way you reassess your judgment of what is crazy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It becomes a rapidly escalating obsession .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What seemed like a hardcore event reserved solely for proper endurance loons soon becomes just within reach .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Six years after the GER, the only event I still consider to be bonkers beyond belief is the Marathon des Sables .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And that's only because everyone knows that Scots melt in the desert .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My personal theory for the rise of the extreme sports is that life has become sterile .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The chances of really getting an adrenaline rush in day-to-day life is minimal , so people search out ways to re-engage with life .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After completing two Ironman events , I can testify that the feeling of sweeping down the finish chute after 140.6 miles to pumping pop music , flashing lights and a cheering crowd is the ultimate buzz .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But finishing a marathon, in an empty car park, in the dark, in the pouring rain , is easily its equal for an overwhelming inner sense of achievement .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The other personal joy I get from training for events is the quiet time .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although modern life is humdrum , it is noisy , and even a three-mile run gives me the chance to clear my head, breathe cold fresh air and feel the wind on my skin .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Max Factor has appointed Marilyn Monroe as its new ""global ambassador"", leaving some people bemused at the idea of selecting an ambassador who has been dead since 1962 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They seem to suspect this might limit her diplomatic utility .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But Monroe represents just what Max Factor wants to resuscitate: the glamour for which the company was once a byword .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the era of classic Hollywood (about 1920-1965), Max Factor ran the only cosmetic game in town , pioneering the use of makeup for cinema, and then, with his sons, adapting and selling those products commercially .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Monroe remains one of the most iconic Hollywood movie stars , and Max Factor's spokeswoman said they chose her because she epitomises their history .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Marilyn made the sultry red lip, creamy skin and dramatically lined eyes the most famous beauty look of the 1940s , and it's a look that continues to dominate the beauty and fashion industry . It is the ultimate look that defines glamour  - nothing else compares,"" the spokeswoman said .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The campaign will emphasise Monroe's metamorphosis , it was reported this week, from ""mousey"" Norma Jeane Mortenson to glamorous Marilyn Monroe, a decision that seems, at face value, rather canny .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Certainly it has stirred up a bit of welcome publicity around the campaign , which claims in particular that it was Max Factor Jr's idea to bleach the star's naturally chestnut hair to that famous platinum blonde .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ad campaign reads: ""From Norma Jeane to Marilyn Monroe . Created By Max Factor."" Hang on, boys .",other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Created by whom?  If Max Factor wants to emphasise history it should start by paying a little more attention to it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Monroe had her first - tiny - film role in 1947 ; she did not have her first starring role until 1952 .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Throughout the 1940s, she was still ""mousey"" Norma Jeane .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For my book on Monroe, I read every major biography then published, as well as many ancillary accounts - about 300 books in all .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not one reported that Max Factor suggested the aspiring starlet should bleach her hair .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't think any of them mentioned Max Factor at all .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead ,  nearly all credit a woman named Emmeline Snively, the head of Monroe's first modelling agency, with whom she signed in 1945 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Snively gave Marilyn lessons in fashion, lighting and grooming, and , most biographers report , recommended that she lighten her hair , ""because a blonde could be photographed in any wardrobe and in any light"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By 1946 the model Norma Jeane had appeared on 33 magazine covers - quite a feat for a ""mousey"" young woman waiting to be created by Max Factor .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Marilyn Monroe was not created by Max Factor - or by her studio head, Darryl F Zanuck (who hated her) ; or by her agent, Johnny Hyde , who paid for her to have minor plastic surgery (to the tip of her nose and her jawline) and got her first big roles ; or by any of her directors, or husbands, or any other of a legion of men, and a handful of women , who have tried to claim the credit, now including Max Factor's heirs .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She was not created by makeup, in any sense : cosmetics were not sufficient to create Marilyn Monroe , and neither were other people .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Emmeline Snively herself said that what distinguished the girl she knew was how hard she worked : ""She wanted to learn , wanted to be somebody, more than anybody I ever saw before in my life.""  Everyone from Elton John to Joyce Carol Oates (who should know better) has trotted out this tenacious, tiresome story : ""ordinary"" Norma Jeane was changed by someone else into the glamorous movie star Marilyn Monroe .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But Norma Jeane Baker , as she was known in childhood (Mortenson was the name on her birth certificate , but she never knew her father) , was always an extremely beautiful girl .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An army photographer discovered her when she was 19 , working at a munitions factory .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She went on to be a popular model on the cover of dozens of magazines before she bleached her hair or focused her look .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There was never anything ""mousey"" about this woman , and when she changed her hair, her makeup, and her name , she didn't become a different person .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She created an iconic style , which she developed in collaboration with her personal makeup artist for many years, Whitey Snyder .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No doubt Marilyn attended the Max Factor beauty salon near Hollywood Boulevard in the 1940s, along with hundreds of other young starlets .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have no reason to disbelieve that she may have worked with Max Factor Jr himself in the 1950s , once she was famous .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But no one except Marilyn Monroe created Marilyn Monroe , and in 2015 it's past time for us to give credit to the woman who earned it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"By 10.30am my GP will telephone me at work with the results of a brain scan I had a couple of days before: an acoustic neuroma, sitting behind my right ear, 42mm in size - a brain tumour .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My face is sagging on the right side , I get sores on the right-hand corner of my mouth due to the drool that manages to escape because of facial weakness on that side .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Less obvious are the hidden symptoms .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Right-sided facial numbness; overwhelming fatigue; tinnitus and reduced hearing in my right ear; a lack of co-ordination leading to an overpowering unsteadiness .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All because I have this 42mm tumour that is taking up space in my head , slowly strangling the nerves relating to hearing, balance and facial sensation .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel stupid for not noticing and not pursuing some of the symptoms when I first experienced them years ago .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I listened to others too much when they told me it was normal and didn't listen to myself when I knew it was not .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is a certain amount of relief when you finally get a diagnosis, especially one so definitive .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can get you out of almost anything .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I've felt the power every time I've said it , but I still don't believe it's happening to me .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My sister had breast cancer three years ago and it's taken all this time to stop the illness dominating her life .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She has stopped obsessively searching for lumps, and says : ""It's history, old news , like it happened to someone else.""  Will I ever acknowledge the reality of what's happening to me? I'm a 41-year- old woman, married, with no kids by choice .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Children would mess up the vice - like grip my husband and I like to have on our lives .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My morning commute takes an hour and a half so I read prolifically .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"After the relief of diagnosis, fear sets in .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I know the snail's pace at which the NHS usually moves , so watching it jump into action induces panic in me .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Within a couple of days, the hotshot neurosurgeon calls .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He tells me it is a slow-growing tumour that I have probably had for years and that a few more weeks while they plan my operation won't make any difference .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He tells me that as acoustic neuromas go , this one's big , but the good news is it's benign , it's not cancer , though it must come out and soon .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then the bad news - I will lose all hearing in that ear and one side of my face may be permanently paralysed from the operation .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The news that I didn't have cancer didn't register ; I was too busy counting my losses .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A few days later I went to a support group for people with brain tumours , where I met people with brain cancer .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Their lumps were in places like the memory, speech or personality part of their brains , and for some the prognosis wasn't good .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The phone call they got from their doctors was much worse than mine .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The internet tells me these types of tumours grow at a rate of about 1mm a year .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If they have a spurt they might make it to 2mm a year .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have two main worries .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first is the horror of surrendering myself to it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have to turn up at the hospital at 7.30am .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are trusting me to have eaten or drunk nothing for at least six hours .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like an inmate at a prison, I will have my possessions checked in .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They will give me a gown to wear that is not my own .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"People like my yoga teacher , who didn't run a mile when I approached her for help , but instead restored some of my balance and made me feel strong .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My second worry is something I've never been good at in my life .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now I must face it head-on - the unknown .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The doctors can't tell me how long my hospital stay will be .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will they need to open me up again because my brain is bleeding? Will I have to have a shunt fitted because fluid isn't draining from my head? Will the surgeon sneeze and nick my facial nerve?  Most suffering is in the worry .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"That includes visitor services, school bookings, public information and even complaints .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Tupe - Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) - regulations require , staff will transfer to a private company on the same terms , but that's weak protection : they can be sent to work anywhere in that company .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As one fearful gallery assistant says : ""I came to work at the National Gallery , but I could be transferred to a supermarket car park.""  This is the only national museum in London not paying the living wage .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"That's how private companies profit from these contracts : as old staff leave , new staff can be hired at any pay rate .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One gallery trustee I spoke to admitted that CIS had been brought in to run the Sainsbury wing to give the gallery staff a fright .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Various causes have been cited : not enough money, too many ill people, the government, the previous government and GPs .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But a major contributory factor appears to be the NHS 111 helpline .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's the number you're now supposed to ring if you don't need an ambulance .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not any time you don't need an ambulance, obviously .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not, for example , when you need a fire engine or the police instead - stick with 999 for those .",no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On balance .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because , come to think of it , you might actually need an ambulance .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I absolutely can't think of a simpler way of describing it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It seems that NHS 111 works slightly differently from NHS Direct , which preceded it and was staffed by nurses , in that very few of the people who answer the phone are medically trained .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have no more chance of fixing a human body themselves than someone in an EE call centre has of generating a 3G signal using an alkaline battery and a radio transmitter .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They work off a computer system called Pathways which tells them what questions to ask and then , the answers having been typed in , what advice to give .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As triage goes , this is flawed .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The first stage of it - the decision to opt for 111 rather than, on the one hand, 999 or, on the other, a paracetamol and a lie-down - is conducted by the patients themselves .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This ensures that the new service gets a nice mix of those who are definitely dying but don't want to be any trouble and malingerers who are losing the courage of their convictions .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then the next stage is a sort of medical version of those magazine surveys that claim to tell you whether you're romantic or sociopathic or spiritual or a typical Scorpio .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But ,  regardless of whether most of your answers are As, Bs or Cs , the system still just advises you to consult someone trained to diagnose whether there' s anything really wrong with you , rather than waste any more time describing your nasty rash to a guy whose last job was cold-calling about missold PPIs .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And that's what causes the trouble for A&E;: the combination of a risk-averse computer algorithm, call centre staff who don't want blood on their hands and the scarcity of GP appointments on public holidays, weekends and when there' s good skiing to be had , is driving thousands of 111 callers into A&E ; to be put on a trolley and ignored like a rum baba in a 70s restaurant .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The solution is simple : the algorithm needs some backbone .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By which I don't mean that the decisions should be taken by actual live vertebrates - that's obviously unworkably expensive .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But we need to be honest with ourselves : the whole point of this phone line is to fob people off  - to stop them going to hospital , not encourage them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deep down, they want to be told they're fine and to stop moaning - otherwise they would've dialled 999 - so a new version of Pathways needs to be designed with that in mind ...  Ring ring .",no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Q Are you aware that, in a significant percentage of the remaining cases, there's no effective treatment and so it's probably kinder to remain undiagnosed?

"When any service is free , demand is unlimited .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aneurin Bevan feared the NHS would put doctors out of work as people got richer and less ill .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was wrong .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As they got rich they lived longer and demanded more care .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even where care costs money , as in America, demand soars .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The NHS needs 5% more cash a year in real terms to meet rising demand , without improvement .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no way this can continue indefinitely .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So what happens? Where demand is unlimited , supply must be rationed somehow .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As economists know , if it is not rationed by payment - as in most insurance - based health services - it is rationed ""by congestion"", by queueing .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is precisely what is now happening in the NHS .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"With a month to go before presidential elections , Africa's most populous country is losing the war against a fullblown Islamist insurgency .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So what is the Nigerian government doing about it?  In 2013 President Goodluck Jonathan , who is up for re-election , declared war on Boko Haram and dispatched the Nigerian army to battle them .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But Boko Haram not only fended off the army's offensive , it ended up being emboldened by the obvious ineptitude of the Nigerian forces .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soldiers meant to be protecting cities and towns have sometimes taken to their heels when Boko Haram's fighters arrived on the scene , leaving inhabitants at the mercy of the Islamists .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the problem isn't that Nigerian soldiers are cowardly , it is that they are woefully under-equipped, under-trained and far too demotivated to tackle the well-armed Boko Haram fighters .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The governor of Borno, the state most affected by Boko Haram, has publicly stated that the Islamists are much better armed than the soldiers .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The reason the Nigerian army is in such poor shape is simple : corruption .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The military's annual budget exceeds ? 4bn, but rather than equip and train frontline troops , there are complaints that much of the funds end up in senior officers' pockets .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soldiers who complain have been known to be court-martialed and sentenced to death for ""mutiny"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As commander-in-chief, this is where Jonathan could have been expected to step in .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But rather than confront the army top brass the Nigerian president has opted to bury his head in the sand and place the blame for Boko Haram's success on everyone bar himself .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When news emerged last year of the kidnap of the Chibok girls, instead of reacting swiftly Jonathan hesitated for two weeks , suggesting there was no kidnap, only a plot by his political opponents to discredit him .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At other times he has shrugged off Boko Haram's deadly attacks as little more than the unavoidable localised version of global jihad, implying with his tone and body language that hundreds of citizens getting killed every week is something Nigerians will simply have to get used to .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After a deadly bomb blast killed more than 100 people in the capital Abuja last year , Jonathan was pictured dancing away at a political rally the next day .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Travelling around the country over the past few weeks , my impression is that Nigerians are increasingly looking to the main opposition presidential candidate, Muhammadu Buhari, a former general and one-time military ruler, as the country's best hope of tackling Boko Haram .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Under ""normal"" conditions Buhari, a conservative Muslim from the north who ruled Nigeria with an iron fist from 1983-85 , would have little hope of support in the country's southern, predominantly Christian region .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Without outstanding charisma, eloquence or competence on policy detail, the 72-year-old Buhari has already made three unsuccessful bids for president .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But after a year in which Boko Haram and government corruption has dominated local headlines , the ex-general has two things going for him: a reputation for strong leadership and incorruptibility .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He is probably the only prominent Nigerian politician today who isn't hounded by allegations of embezzling public funds .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A president with military experience to take on corrupt army officers would surely serve as a morale booster to the Nigerian soldiers battling Boko Haram .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Granted , the ex-general has no magic wand to make the militants simply vanish .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If my colleagues are serious about restraining Iran's nuclear ambitions , they will resist the temptation to intervene and instead let our negotiators finish the job .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Altering the terms or objectives of the talks would amount to moving the goalposts when the end zone is in sight - with potentially devastating consequences .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"November's four-month extension of the ""P5+1"" negotiations (called so because of the participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) confirmed both the difficulty of the remaining issues and the importance of continuing to negotiate .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We are still several steps short of a complete and lasting termination of Iran's nuclear weapons program , but the current interim agreement between Iran and the international community - known as the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) - is a vast improvement over 18 months ago , when Iran's nuclear program was still expanding and shrouded in secrecy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While the JPOA is only a temporary agreement , Iran has complied with it and verifiably frozen and rolled back its nuclear program , demonstrating that it is willing to take negotiations seriously .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Congress could play an important oversight role while negotiators work to build on this progress and secure a verifiable and lasting nuclear agreement with Iran .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But acting peremptorily to demand specific concessions from Iran could destabilize the diplomatic balance needed for negotiations to both continue and ultimately succeed .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It would be unwise, for example , to lay out unrealistic or overly-specific requirements for a final agreement to be acceptable to Congress .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Likewise ,  the nuclear negotiating table is not the place to compel Iran to clean up its act on issues unrelated to nonproliferation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Iran engages in an array of behaviors that the US and the international community find unacceptable, such as persecuting political opponents and religious minorities, and supporting terrorist organizations like Hezbollah .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But we must not insist that everything be solved before anything is solved ; a nuclear agreement is and should be our first priority , and such an agreement could facilitate progress on other fronts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Imposing new or less flexible economic sanctions  - which has been proposed by a number of my congressional colleagues, including Senators Kirk and Menendez - could do great damage to our prospects for a nuclear agreement with Iran .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New punitive action could strengthen Iranian hard-liners and make their withdrawal from the negotiations more likely .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Acting unilaterally could also undermine the stability of our international alliance, and thereby actually weaken the existing international sanctions regime .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The existing sanctions are, of course, a major reason that Iran is at the negotiating table , and Congress should stand ready to reimpose and strengthen them should Iran violate the terms of the JPOA or any future nuclear agreement .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But taking punitive action now could send a message that Congress does not stand behind the negotiators .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We cannot lose sight of the fact that a verifiable nuclear agreement with Iran would make our country, Israel, the Middle East and the world much safer .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The nuclear talks with Iran could still crumble under the pressure of opposition and distrust both inside and outside Iran .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We don't know who died , but the Associated Press assured us they were ""militants"", despite the US government's definition of ""militant"" having been manipulated beyond comprehension .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US Congress, of course, has steadfastly refused to attempt to place any real legislative limits on drone strikes, even those that have killed American citizens - which , as various scholars have been screaming for years , represent an unconstitutional violation of the Fifth Amendment .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile ,  the Defense Department quietly announced a few days before Christmas that , later this month, another 1,300 troops will deploy to Iraq in its ever-expanding undeclared war on Isis .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Now , almost five months in to a war the administration freely admits will last for years if not decades, hardly anyone seems to care what legal experts across the political spectrum believe : this war is without precedent - and it's illegal without Congressional approval .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"When the news arrived from the White House on Tuesday that Barack Obama would veto the GOP's Keystone pipeline bill - or at least ""that the president would not sign this bill"" as is - I thought back to a poll that the National Journal conducted of its ""energy insiders"" in the fall of 2011 , just when then issue was heating up .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Keystone's not dead yet - feckless Democrats in the Congress could make some kind of deal later this month or later this year , and the president could still yield down the road to the endlessly corrupt State Department bureaucracy that continues to push the pipeline - but it's pretty amazing to see what happens when people organize .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The fight against the XL pipeline began with indigenous people in Canada, and spread to ranchers along the pipeline route in places like Nebraska .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And then, in the spring of 2011 , when the climate scientist Jim Hansen pointed out the huge pool of carbon in the Canadian tar sands , the fight spread to those of us in the nascent climate movement .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We had no real hope of stopping Keystone - as the National Journal poll indicated , this seemed the most done of deals - but we also had no real choice but to try .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And so people went to jail in larger numbers than they had for many years, and wrote more emails to the Senate than on pretty much any issue in history, and made more public comments to the government than on any infrastructure project in history .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And all that effort didn't just tie up this one pipeline in knots .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It also scared investors enough that they shut down three huge planned new tar-sands mines, taking $17bn in capital and millions of tons of potential emissions off the table .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And it helped embolden people to fight every other pipeline, and coal port, and frack field, and coal mine .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Keystone fights helped spur a full-on fossil-fuel resistance that now mounts a powerful challenge to the entire fossil-fuel industry at every single turn .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advertising to children is another issue requiring intervention .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Burnham intends to ask the committee on advertising practice and the Advertising Standards Authority how children can be better protected .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Has there ever been so much debate about a debate? The negotiations about this year's TV leader's debates sank to a new low last week, with David Cameron appearing to use the fact that the Greens now look likely to be excluded as an opportunity to bow out .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Far from a principled stance, this came across as a self-serving attempt to get out of jail free , following as it did in the wake of his equivocation about whether he would participate in the debates he once so enthusiastically embraced as challenger rather than incumbent .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cameron's decision to pull out of an online video debate for first-time voters also reflects poorly on his motives .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Surely if he really wanted the Greens involved he would have co - ordinated a call from all three party leaders to the broadcasters to include them in the debates? In the face of such cross-party consensus it would have been unthinkable for them to refuse .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is a damning indictment that the political parties cannot even agree on a format for a series of election debates .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One has to question where that leaves the real challenges facing the country that will require a degree of cross - party consensus to tackle over the next decade , in a time when increasing political instability looks set to be the norm .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Long-term reform of the NHS and care systems to cope with an ageing population or restructuring the banks to insulate us against another financial crisis are issues far more complex and thorny than a debate format .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This episode reveals two further truths .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  all our leaders have claimed to want to change the nature of the conversation between politicians and voters .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But too often these claims are undermined .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ed Miliband argued for a new politics in July 2014 , shunning the shallowness of husky-themed photo-ops .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He launched his election campaign with a promise Labour activists will engage in four million conversations , talking to people on doorsteps rather than communicating using poster campaigns .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the authenticity of this has been undercut by Labour's continued reliance on negative campaigning, including their election broadcast ridiculing Nick Clegg as the ""Un-Credible Shrinking Man"" who has abandoned his principles, and leaked strategy documents telling candidates to move on when voters raise immigration as an issue .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cameron's attempt to extract himself from debates that attracted tens of millions of viewers in the run-up to the last election undermines these claims by the political class even further .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It smacks of politicians only interested in pursuing a new style of politics when it suits their strategy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second ,  the disagreement around the debates is a symptom of the extent to which Britain's two-party majoritarian system is breaking down .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The vote share of the two main parties has steadily declined in recent decades to the extent that it no longer looks as if the two parties will be able to sustain a majority under the current electoral system .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are now in the territory where their declining vote share means first past the post is beginning to deliver what increasingly looks like arbitrary rather than democratically credible outcomes .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is nonsensical for the Greens to be excluded on the basis of their vote share in an electoral system that provides strong disincentives to vote for them in the first place .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition for them to be included and eight in 10 voters think they should take part .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ofcom's decision that they don't have sufficient support to accord them ""major party status"" and the broadcasters' reluctance to invite them to participate have the ring of a political establishment desperately trying to cling on to the cartel-like status quo .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A political rulebook that better reflects the more pluralistic politics developing in Britain would do more than any speech or campaign to facilitate a more honest, authentic conversation with the public .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cameron's attempt to wriggle out of the debates is shameful and he must accept the invitation issued by the Guardian, Telegraph and YouTube to take part in an online debate including the Greens .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But he should be doing much more : he should be leading a national conversation involving all the party leaders about how the pluralism of the electorate can be represented in a more democratic system of politics .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Maybe it's inevitable , now that Julian Assange , has spent almost 1,500 days in the bowels of the Ecuadorian embassy , that memories of how he came to be in there grow ever more hazy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With a forgetfulness that , if genuine , demonstrates how rapidly the most preposterous inventions can acquire the status of fact , even his colleagues at WikiLeaks have convinced themselves that Assange was incarcerated by a British government determined to keep him quiet .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Among the more opportunistic tweets responding to the massacre in Paris , came this , from the WikiLeaks account : ""David Cameron pontificates about freedom of speech while spending millions detaining #Assange without trial."" At this impressive rate of fabulation, the 2,000th day should see our unhappy visionary gagged in a dripping cell as he awaits the death sentence applied to all fugitives who dare speak freely in the Kafkaesque nightmare that is 21st- century Britain .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It would bear as much relation to the facts, after all, as the current myth of his forced detention without trial .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So , to recap : in June 2012, Assange, founder of WikiLeaks , was in the UK, free to speak on any subject he liked , and fighting extradition from Britain to Sweden , where he faced allegations of sexual assaults on two women .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Preferring to break his bail conditions rather than clear his name in Sweden , he sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy , where he remains to this day .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is a source of consternation , at least outside his support base , that the cost of policing the embassy so as to enforce the legal process should Assange ever emerge , has now exceeded ? 9m .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last November, an arrest warrant for Assange was upheld in a Swedish court .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In short ,  #Assange is not ""detained"" by anyone or anything other than his own reluctance to face questioning about alleged sex offences, in a country where extradition to the US is no more likely than it is here .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But maybe this confusion about his journey from free-speech celebrity to pallid hermit helps one understand why Assange, though accused of sex offences, has survived much of the public opprobrium, internet gossip and suspicion that dogs other individuals associated with accusations of sexual misconduct, such as the harassment expert Julien Blanc or the Lib Dem octopus, Lord Rennard .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To the contrary .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the website where a petition denounces the footballer and convicted rapist Ched Evans , thousands demand the Nobel prize, along with freedom and protection, for Assange ; his admirers even attempted to kickstart funds for a statue , honouring the man who has portrayed his Swedish accusers as instruments in a smear campaign .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Other analysts, however, have detected enough evidence of female self-determination to attribute the women's hostility to everything from sexual jealousy to a bad case of radical feminism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Clearly, Assange's better-informed supporters , who include celebrities such as Lady Gaga, Arundhati Roy and Vivienne Westwood , will be aware of the Swedish allegations and have chosen, for one reason or another , to set them aside .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A similar immunity seems to have been conferred on Prince Andrew, following allegations of his sexual impropriety with a minor who worked for his American friend, a convicted paedophile .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Though ""emphatically denied"" , with the extra benefit of a character reference from Andrew's ex-wife , who was lent money by the paedophile , there has been no announcement of the type of legal manoeuvre that the similarly accused Alan Dershowitz is pursuing after allegations that he also took sexual advantage of the 17-year-old .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet Andrew, too, has so far escaped a petition objecting to him ""assisting the economic success of our United Kingdom"" , as the palace describes his various holidays .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps , as happened to the creepy Blanc when he attempted to visit the UK , some other country would be good enough to help out with a banning order .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If the difference between unproven allegations and, in Ched Evans's case, a formal conviction, can satisfactorily explain this variability in public tolerance , the footballer's supporters are surely entitled to compare his treatment unfavourably with, for example, that of Roman Polanski .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why have opponents of Evans's return to football, now or ever, not shown similar concern about the film director's rehabilitation? Polanski's return to Poland, for filming , has just prompted another US extradition request , that he be returned to face sentencing pending since 1978 , when he admitted unlawful sex with a 13-year-old .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It must help, of course , that successful film directors have not been classified, by whichever national committee rules on fitness for role- modelling, as officially inspirational .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Polanski, like his colleague Woody Allen , who embarked, in his mid-50s, on an affair with his partner's 19-year- old daughter, sister to three of his children , cannot be accused of betraying impressionable fans, those millions of starstruck kiddies whose wee moral compasses are left spinning wildly when their idols fall short .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That responsibility is still monopolised , as repeatedly confirmed in ongoing Evans analysis, by the profession that is, for many of us, more strongly associated than any other - no disrespect to full-time pimps or Sun newspaper editors - with vulgarity, aggression, racism, irresponsibility and contempt for women .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Professional Footballers' Association's Gordon Taylor's casual analogy between the plight of Evans, the convicted rapist , and that of the bereaved Hillsborough families only confirms that the profession that gave us Rooney's ""auld slapper"", Sky Sport's ""did you smash it"" , and ,  yet more recently , the Premier League Richard Scudamore's ""big-titted broads"" work-account remains institutionally unworthy of redemption, at least where women are concerned .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maybe it is not irrationally high expectations of football's young ambassadors, so much as an evidence-based recoil from its culture , that has fuelled a special implacability towards Ched Evans, to the point of closing down his career .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His only hope of eventual re-employment in football, at this point, is not , surely ,  his future father-in-law's website, but either a) an open letter from Naomi Wolf, feminist and champion of Julian Assange, or b) an appearance by Whoopi Goldberg protesting that Evans's was not ""rape-rape"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Polanski also benefited from extensive celebrity support, including , when he was arrested in Switzerland in 2009 , a petition for his release signed by, among the British luminaries, Salman Rushdie, Sam Mendes, Stephen Frears, Terry Gilliam, Jeremy Irons, Emma Thompson and Tilda Swinton .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Everyone in international film-making , they said , wanted Polanksi ""to know that he has their support and friendship"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps there should be one law for acclaimed intellectuals and another for men such as Ched Evans? But if not, the latter must have at least as good a case as Polanski for re-employment , once he has completed his sentence .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alternatively , if a serious sex conviction should cost a footballer his entire career (along with the professions routinely closed to sex offenders) then a similar vigilance should, surely, be applied to discernible sleazebaggery in any other profession, from whistleblowing to royal work , where clemency might be mistaken for approval .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Unlike 50 years ago , when a tiny, socially elite proportion went to university , they will be joining almost 50% of their peers in studying for a degree, facing average costs of upwards of ? 46k for a three-year degree, including tuition and living costs, compared with the generous grants available up until the 1990s .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Setting expansion aside , it is remarkable how much hasn't changed: at the heart of the system remains a core model of young people moving away to university to study for three-year full-time degrees ; an expensive route for which they now bear much of the costs themselves .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet the jobs market has changed beyond recognition .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Graduates are now responsible for forging their own careers in a fluid market compared with the jobs for life that were the norm a few decades ago and employers are demanding a completely different set of skills .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Does this model, then , remain fit for purpose?  The political debate has focused on fee levels and headline prices to the exclusion of almost everything else, including the benefits and value of a university education - and how they might be improved .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The debate about whether the 50% participation target is too high has been similarly staid : surely it's a no-brainer to hope that at least half of young people engage in advanced learning .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But what type of learning should that be?  One of the purported benefits of marketising higher education was that the market itself would deliver innovation and better value .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the government massively overegged the potential for higher education to behave like a market .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Student demand far exceeds supply of places and price has become a proxy for quality .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Little wonder, then , that average fees are far higher than the ? 6,000 a year that the then universities minister, David Willetts, predicted when he introduced the ? 9,000 fee cap .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We now have the nonsense of a market where students pay the same for very different amounts and quality of academic provision .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is reflected in the variation in students' own perceptions : research by the consumer body Which? found almost a third of first-year undergraduates thought their course was poor value for money , while less than half thought seminars were worth attending .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is too little accountability for this variation within the powerful sector : universities award their own degrees ; the sector is opaque , even resisting moves to publish comparable information on the amount of teaching students can expect for their fees ; and the higher education regulator is weak, with virtually no powers to tell universities to buck up standards .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The debate about innovation has centred on distance learning and Moocs (Massive Online Open Courses) .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no doubt developments in technology have the potential to transform the way university education is experienced .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it's pointless to focus on technology at the expense of changes that need to happen in the system in order to take advantage of it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moocs will not transform the sector until they are embraced by the most prestigious universities : why shouldn't you be able to study for a cut-price Oxford degree, half via YouTube and Skype, and half among the dreaming spires?  Other innovations that could bring down costs without sacrificing quality might be a restructure of the system to standardise first-year curriculums , enabling young people to combine studying for a year or two at their local university with a year or two on campus at a more specialist institution .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We could see more professional degrees co-delivered and funded by universities and employers, such as the accountancy degree offered by Durham and KPMG in which young people benefit from six years of combined university and work experience .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Or there could be more intensive two-year courses, perhaps aimed at young people getting a year or two of work experience after school .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"University could be combined with more modern ways of adjusting to adulthood : for example ,  a year spent in a structured volunteering programme, such as that offered by the charity City Year, offers huge opportunities to develop the grit and teamwork so valued by today's employers , while making a real contribution to schools and other public services .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But on some measures we are moving backwards, with a massive fall in numbers of part-time and mature students in the few years since the ? 9,000 fee cap was introduced .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are lessons from the 1960s , when Harold Wilson's government realised that the only way to increase access in the face of a reluctant sector was to back Michael Young's vision for a new institution, the Open University , which increased the student population by Britain by a fifth when it was launched via its distance learning degrees .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Government can't simply wait for the sector to do what it is asked to do .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It needs to foster a conversation with universities, students and employers about what it means to get a degree .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course there will always be a role for the academic .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shootings have been described as an act of war .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can understand why some might characterise it that way .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But they are wrong to do so , for isn't this exactly what the violent extremists such as Da'esh, so-called Islamic State, want? They want to say the west is at war with Islam , but if we are to take the action of marginal groups and use that as evidence that there is a war between Islam and the west , aren't we merely falling into a trap?  George Bush fell into that very trap immediately after 9/11 by calling it the war on terror , but actually he promoted it with his rhetoric .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What mysterious force is sowing peace among humankind? One possible reason is that there are more atheists and nonbelievers than ever before .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In America, millennials are the largest and least religious generation in the country's history .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The trend toward secularization in the US mirrors the movement in Europe and throughout the developed world .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And poll after poll have shown that the nonreligious also lean more progressive and more pacifist on a wide variety of issues relating to violence: torture, the death penalty, corporal punishment, military adventurism and more .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A Pew poll from 2009, well before the Senate released its devastating torture report last month, asked whether torturing suspected terrorists could be justified found that the non-religious were most opposed to torture , with a combined 55% saying that it could rarely or never be justified .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gallup has also found that people with no religious preference are less supportive of the death penalty than any group of Christians .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The non-religious are also among the most likely to say the invasion of Iraq was a mistake .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"As Phil Lutton points out , Mayweather has been arrested or cited by police in seven assaults against five different women .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mayweather's history of domestic violence began in 2001, just a month after dedicating his fight against Diego ""Chico"" Corrales to ""all the battered women in the world."" He allegedly closed a car door on his then-partner Melissa Brim before repeatedly punching her while she lay on the back seat .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not six months later he punched Brim in the neck at a Las Vegas shopping centre .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He pleaded guilty and received a suspended sentence .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In 2003 Mayweather allegedly punched two friends of his then-partner (and the mother of several of his children) Josie Harris in a nightclub and shook a female security guard .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He was issued a citation and found guilty of two counts of battery , though the verdict was vacated and the charges were ""dismissed per negotiations.""  The same year he allegedly pummelled Harris and dragged her from a car by her hair , though she later dropped the charges and testified that she had lied to police .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mayweather bought Harries a $500,000, 25-carat diamond ring shortly afterwards .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In 2011 he finally did jail time (90 days) for savagely beating Harris in front of their children .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He might have done many more if he wasn't a multi- millionaire and a linchpin of the economy in his home state of Nevada .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even boxing fans , who are usually loathe to judge fighters for their conduct outside the ring (few boxers are angels, after all) , are unimpressed with Mayweather .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And though boxing is a bit of a cultural afterthought these days, comments Mayweather made in support of abuser Ray Rice before his most recent fight focused the attention of the mainstream media on his unsavoury past .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nevertheless ,  he was unrepentant .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Though Mayweather's criminal past might not automatically disqualify him from receiving an Australian visa , he would have to sit a ""character test"" on arrival .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you watch the video above , I'm sure you'll agree that such a test could be a major stumbling block .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a similar case, Australia granted Mike Tyson , who was jailed for rape in 1992, a visa in 2012 , though New Zealand did not .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So should Australia bar Mayweather? What's to gain from him visiting? He's a disgusting, unrepentant assaulter of women and his ""I do what I want-ism"" is totally undesirable .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"America might be stuck with him , but I don't see why we should welcome him and allow him to make money in our country .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last year Australia cancelled the visa of pick up artist Julien Blanc , whose techniques included simulated choking of women in bars, after a social media campaign and protests at venues .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There has been nothing simulated about Mayweather's repeated punching of the women in his life , so I'd imagine he (and the venues that welcome him) can expect the same treatment .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On a more selfish note, I simply can't face the prospect of sections of the Australian media writing seriously about Anthony Mundine fighting Mayweather .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"There have been upheavals in schools, the health service and the benefits system , but those revolutions belong to Michael Gove, Andrew Lansley and Iain Duncan Smith .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cameron gave permission , he never pioneered .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cameron has also said he abhors ""isms"" and wouldn't want posterity to anoint him with one .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Friends say this makes him a practical conservative of the old school , guided by ancient and uncodified British instincts of decency .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His enemies think that is a posh way of saying he lacks principle .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With no pattern of belief associated with his name, Cameron's legacy will be a collection of tactical manoeuvres, with as many prominent surrenders as victories .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The true spirit of ""Cameronism"" in education, for example, is better conveyed in the removal in 2014 of Gove to placate the teaching profession than in his appointment to shake up the department in the first place .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But in no field is the Tory leader's trademark better defined than in his approach to Europe .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If any political manoeuvre deserves to be named after the Conservative leader , it is the habit of trying to sate the appetites of hardline Eurosceptics with morsels that would always leave them hungry .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It might be called the ""Cameron concession"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thus has he fed the Eurosceptic pack enough to keep it snapping at his heels and frustrated it enough that his voice was drowned by angry barking .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perhaps the saddest aspect of this spectacle is that it saw a potentially sound policy trampled in the melee .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The outline of Cameron's position is that Britain should stay in the EU but under changed terms .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They will change anyway because the priority for most other member states is bolstering the single currency .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This involves the integration of a euro-core with serious implications for Britain's status one way or another .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the principle of pro- active renegotiation, ratified by referendum, is sound .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But Cameron spoiled a plausible position with cowardice : he set his renegotiation up as an empty vessel into which hardliners poured Ukip-ish fantasies of ending immigration .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He bought the argument that says the terms on offer from Brussels get better the closer Britain gets to the exit , although that logic is commonly advanced by people who want the negotiations to fail .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The deadline for his referendum, the end of 2017, was plucked from thin air without regard for what was diplomatically feasible or economically wise .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the chief reason Cameron's EU policy hasn't worked for him is that voters also consider motive when awarding merit .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Those who want a referendum in order to leave the EU mistrust the prime minister because he wants a different outcome ; and pro-Europeans don't trust Cameron to defend Britain's interests in Europe because the whole policy came about as a sop to the sceptics .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That doesn't leave many people who think the Tories have the right policy for the right reason .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Europe exemplifies the problem , but it runs deeper .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cameron's team are sure they are running on an admirable record: economic growth, rising employment, lower crime, a reduced deficit and reformed welfare .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These are things, like the EU referendum , that should make the Tories popular .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By the same calculation, Labour, lacking those credentials, should be out of the running .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet the campaign has started and Ed Miliband is still ahead .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Downing Street clings to the now familiar explanation that voters haven't properly engaged with the choice , and that the Tory surge will come at the eleventh hour when the reality of a possible Miliband regime penetrates the national consciousness .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But what if Cameron has hit the limit of credit available for five years in charge because even the good bits don't connect in people's minds with decent motives?  That is what Labour strategists are banking on .,par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Miliband's personal ratings are bleak, except on measures of decency and empathy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So those are the leadership qualities his campaign aims to project .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The contrast they want to draw is between Cameron's ethical plasticity and a challenger who sticks to his beliefs .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Miliband will be cast as a man guided by what David Axelrod, Barack Obama's former aide now advising Labour, calls ""a north star"" - a compass point that tells voters a leader is propelled by something more noble than the salvation of his own skin .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waverers who don't warm to Miliband (and who aren't irredeemably riddled with anti-Westminster rage) might still be persuaded that he is in politics for the right reason .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The opposite is true of Cameron .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even those in his own party who like the direction of policy cannot sincerely claim that their leader is driven by much beyond a sense of entitlement to the job .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That was less of an impediment in the past .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For much of the 20th century, Britain was ruled by Conservatives who thought of political theory as something suspect or vulgar , a folly for continentals and socialists, and no substitute for the innate good sense drilled into English boys at the best schools .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Thatcher revolution disrupted the patrician culture in the Conservative party, but not the underlying belief that Tory rule is a default setting for British politics; the norm to which the country tends .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That assumption, more than economic growth, deficit reduction, an EU referendum or any other part of the prospectus, is what makes Cameron think he can stay on after May .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is the confidence that he is an archetypal prime minister and the only credible candidate for the job .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perhaps he will be proved right .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He will have money and much of the press to amplify that view .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But even loyal Conservatives can't entirely ignore the intellectual void at the centre .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The right has decried it as often as the left .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The past five years have posed huge challenges for Britain regarding the economy, our place in Europe, England's relations with Scotland, the decline of trust in institutions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But of which encounter with a great problem can it be said the prime minister truly rose to the occasion? Cameron doesn't have big answers , he shrinks questions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And that is how history will remember him , whatever happens in May .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He successfully pursued power and spent it without purpose .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The arrest and conviction of three al-Jazeera journalists in Egypt has been the subject of a worldwide campaign to secure their release .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The men were seized from a hotel and given long jail sentences on charges of abetting terrorists, spreading false news and endangering national security .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On Friday 2 January 2015 the Guardian published online an interview with Amal Clooney , who represents Mohamed Fahmy, one of the three jailed journalists .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The other two are Baher Mohamed and Peter Greste .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The interview , which ranged over many aspects of the case , was given in the wake of the appeal hearing in Cairo on 1 January in which the three men were told they would have to face a retrial .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During the course of it, Clooney revealed that a report which she co-authored had pinpointed flaws in the Egyptian judicial system that subsequently contributed to the three men's conviction .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She told the Guardian that when the report, compiled on behalf of the International Bar Association, was due to be published ""...first of all they stopped us from doing it in Cairo .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They said : 'Does the report criticise the army, the judiciary, or the government? We said: 'Well , yes .' They said: 'Well then ,  you're risking arrest .'"".  A story headlined : ""Egypt warns Amal Clooney she risks arrest over al-Jazeera three"" was published at 3.19pm on 2 January on the Guardian's website .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The first sentence said : ""Egyptian officials have warned human rights barrister Amal Clooney that she risks arrest after identifying serious flaws in its judicial system that contributed to the conviction of three al-Jazeera journalists now jailed in Cairo.""  However , due to an editing error in London, two key aspects of the story had been conflated , and both the headline and first sentence were wrong .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Clooney had not been warned that she risked arrest ""over the al-Jazeera three"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The warning about what might happen if the report was published in Egypt had been given in February 2014 , long before she had any involvement in the case .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was a significant error .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Patrick Kingsley, the Guardian's Cairo correspondent , who has reported on the case of the three journalists since they were arrested and who also conducted the interview , contacted the Guardian's foreign desk within 35 minutes of the story going up on the website to warn of the errors and amend the copy .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He had received complaints about the headline and the thrust of the story from Clooney .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amendments were made and the headline now ran : ""Egypt warns Amal Clooney she risked arrest"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But there was no footnote or correction published because of the short time lapse between publication and amendment .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While our guidelines state that errors caught within the first hour or so , which have not excited comment , do not necessarily need to be footnoted , I think that on this occasion it was a mistake not to add one .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was a significant error , and one has to recognise that Clooney is a well-known figure .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The amended version was the one used in the print edition published on Saturday 3 January .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At 10.05 on Sunday 4 January the story was updated, with the addition of two paragraphs from the Egyptian police denying the allegation that Clooney faced arrest .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Editors were still concerned that the story lacked clarity , and further changes were made to the first few paragraphs to make the chronology clearer, ie that the warning of possible arrest related to what might happen if the report earmarking judicial flaws was published in Egypt .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These changes were made on the evening of Monday 5 January , and finally a footnote was added : ""This article was amended on 4 January 2015 to include comments from the Egyptian police . It was further edited for clarity on 5 January 2015.""  At this stage there had still been no formal complaint to the readers' editor's office, but by 5pm editors made me aware of the problems .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I wrote a longer, fuller footnote , and a correction was published online that evening and in print on Tuesday 6 January .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However , what I had not initially realised was that Clooney had co-authored an article for the Huffington Post website with Mark Wassouf , who also represents Fahmy, published on Sunday 4 January .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In it, primarily, she set out the issues facing the three men including Fahmy, but also addressing her concerns about the Guardian story .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In it she raised a fresh concern of which we were unaware .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She described those who warned her of a possible arrest if any attempt was made to publish the report as ""experts in Egyptian affairs"" , whereas they were described in the text of the Guardian story as ""Egyptian officials"" and a subheading said she was ""threatened by the authorities"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Huffington Post story said : ""An article was published in the Guardian newspaper on 2 January 2015 stating that officials threatened Amal Clooney with arrest in Egypt in connection with her representation of Fahmy .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The incident that was recounted in fact arose in early 2014 when the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute (IBA)  - which was organizing the launch of a report co-authored by Mrs Clooney - was warned by experts in Egyptian affairs who were consulted on the launch that she and her colleague risked arrest if they launched the report in Cairo, in light of the criticisms made in the report and recent prosecutions for 'crimes' like insulting the judiciary, government or military in Egypt .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result of these warnings , the IBA decided that it was not safe to hold the launch in Cairo , and the authors were forced to hold it in London instead .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This incident arose before Mrs Clooney's involvement in the Fahmy case , before the current president was in office and in a context entirely unrelated to this case ... More importantly, the focus today should not be on the risks that lawyers or journalists faced in the past .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The focus should be on the risks of free speech in today's Egypt.""  When the Guardian asked Clooney on 5 January for more details of the individuals who gave the warning , she replied that the language she used had been reviewed by a colleague in the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute who was involved in writing the report and organising the launch , who agreed with the description that they were ""experts in Egyptian affairs"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am not able to establish any more details about them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think the Guardian believed that, in the context of the interview, the ""they"" to which Clooney refers were Egyptian officials who had given the warning .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But we didn't confirm that before publication, and in the light of that we have made a further set of changes to the headline, subheading and text .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In my view, it is a legitimate story and a matter of public interest that there was a warning of possible arrest in relation to publishing in Egypt a report about flaws flaws in the country's judicial system that subsequently contributed to the conviction of the three men .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The report said Egypt's judicial system was not as independent as it could be .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It pointed out that officials in the ministry of justice have wide powers over nominally independent judges, and highlighted the control the government can exert over state prosecutors .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a clear link .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Or , as I believe I put it in a blog about the trailer , ""Clint Eastwood's American Sniper trailer will ruin your pants.""  But however effective it is as a piece of cinema , even a cursory look into the film's backstory - and particularly the public reaction to its release  - raises disturbing questions about which stories we choose to codify into truth , and whose, and why, and the messy social costs of transmogrifying real life into entertainment .",par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chris Kyle, a US navy Seal from Texas, was deployed to Iraq in 2003 and claimed to have killed more than 255 people during his six-year military career .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""I couldn't give a flying fuck about the Iraqis."" He bragged about murdering looters during Hurricane Katrina , though that was never substantiated .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was murdered in 2013 at a Texas gun range by a 25-year-old veteran reportedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However we diverge politically , I have enough faith in Eastwood's artistry and intellect to trust that he is not a black-and-white ideologue - or, at least , that he knows that the limitations of such a worldview would make for an extremely dull movie .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the same can't be said for Eastwood's subject, or , as response to the film has demonstrated , many of his fans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Laura Miller wrote in Salon : ""In Kyle's version of the Iraq war, the parties consisted of Americans , who are good by virtue of being American , and fanatic Muslims whose 'savage, despicable evil' led them to want to kill Americans simply because they are Christians.""  Adds Scott Foundas at Variety : ""Chris Kyle saw the world in clearly demarcated terms of good and evil , and American Sniper suggests that such dichromatism may have been key to both his success and survival ; on the battlefield, doubt is akin to death.""  Eastwood, on the other hand, Foundas says, ""sees only shades of gray"" , and American Sniper is a morally ambiguous, emotionally complex film .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But there are a lot of Chris Kyles in the world , and the chasm between Eastwood's intent and his audience's reception touches on the old Chappelle's Show conundrum: a lot of white people laughed at Dave Chappelle's rapier racial satire for the wrong reasons, in ways that may have actually exacerbated stereotypes about black people in the minds of intellectual underachievers .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Is that Chappelle's fault? Should he care?  Likewise ,  much of the US right wing appears to have seized upon American Sniper with similarly shallow comprehension - treating it with the same unconsidered, rah-rah reverence that they would the national anthem or the flag itself .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Only a few weeks into its release, the film has been flattened into a symbol to serve the interests of an ideology that, arguably, runs counter to the ethos of the film itself .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How much , if at all , should Eastwood concern himself with fans who misunderstand and misuse his work? If he, intentionally or not, makes a hero out of Kyle - who, bare minimum , was a racist who took pleasure in dehumanising and killing brown people - is he responsible for validating racism, murder, and dehumanisation? Is he a propagandist if people use his work as propaganda?  That question came to the fore last week on Twitter when several liberal journalists drew attention to Kyle's less Oscar-worthy statements .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"There is no room for the idea that Kyle might have been a good soldier but a bad guy ; or a mediocre guy doing a difficult job badly; or a complex guy in a bad war who convinced himself he loved killing to cope with an impossible situation ; or a straight-up serial killer exploiting an oppressive system that, yes , also employs lots of well-meaning, often impoverished, non-serial - killer people to do oppressive things over which they have no control .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now is not the time to retreat from the kind of broadcasting that engages so many voters and illuminates the choices they face .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Naturally, I hope all the major parties take part in the 2015 election debates .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That will rightly remain the aim of the broadcasters . But I believe they should be resolute in the face of a refusal by one party to take part : the empty chair, or the deserted lectern, should be an option .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The BBC guidelines do not specifically cover a national leaders' debate , but the principles they set out argue not just that they can wheel out the empty chair but that they should .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On general output, BBC published editorial policy is that one reluctant participant cannot stop an item : ""The refusal of an individual or an organisation to make a contribution should not be allowed to act as a veto on the appearance of other contributors.""  That is confirmed in the various election guidelines , where over the years the ability of one awkward candidate to stop a broadcast has been removed .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And the BBC and other broadcasters do use the empty chair, albeit on less high-profile occasions : if a news maker is unwilling to face the cameras , best practice is to say so and to cover the topic anyway .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As far back as 1987 , when I was Today's political producer , we empty-chaired Labour in a campaign debate on defence - to the fury of their leadership .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But they had been given every opportunity to take part and had chosen not to , so we went ahead with the other parties and told our listeners what had happened .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is in this current row a legitimate argument about fairness and about who takes part .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The arid bureaucratic view would be that this should be based on the results of the 2010 general election and therefore be a three-way debate between David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The rise of Ukip and the surge in multi-party politics have muddied the waters , and the broadcasters are having to be more flexible , and I think the Greens should be somewhere in the mix .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  I believe we can trust the BBC, ITV and Sky to come up with the right format and a proposal that offers the appropriate levels of exposure to all the parties in the UK across the whole campaign .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is for them , with the appropriate regulators, to make that judgment and not for individual politicians to seek to exclude or include their opponents .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is, in any case, inevitable that some debates of some kind will happen .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Farage v Clegg encounter just ahead of the European election campaign was an example of the asymmetry that may now happen : it was not part of a formal coverage plan , but it was compelling viewing for anyone interested in politics and millions of people tuned in .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The digital debate proposed by the Guardian, Telegraph and Google is one viable alternative ; and there is nothing to stop anyone hiring a hall in Manchester and getting Miliband and Clegg to debate there .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I guarantee the broadcasters would turn up , and it is significant that the opposition parties are willing to take part in debates even without the prime minister .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The broadcasters may, possibly, face a legal challenge about the allocation of national airtime , but in the court of public opinion it would be a brave act to try to close down a debate in which you have been invited to take part but have chosen not to .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are right - now is the time to hold firm .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"At the time of the last election, David Cameron pronounced that TV debates were ""here to stay"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They engaged voters in ways that we hadn't seen before in Britain .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To many, it was unthinkable that they wouldn't become a permanent feature of the fabric of our elections .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It gives me no pleasure to say that I have always had great doubts that this was really the case .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For it to be true , you had to trust the Tory leader not to change his mind .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV debates happened in 2010 only because of an unusual set of circumstances .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr Cameron had demanded them because that is what opposition leaders nearly always do .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nick Clegg wanted to gain exposure that no previous third party leader had enjoyed .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the wake of the expenses scandal, all the parties were anxious to be seen trying to connect with alienated voters .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The key was Gordon Brown .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unusually for a prime minister, he agreed to debates .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His people thought he had little to lose and ,  in a typically Gordon Brownish way , he reckoned he would come over as the man of substance while his Tory and Lib Dem rivals would be exposed as lightweights .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It didn't work out as Mr Brown expected .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But what is most relevant to what is happening now is that it didn't work out as Mr Cameron anticipated either .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Lib Dem leader, an unknown to many voters before the debates, shone in the first one , presenting himself as the true candidate of change to the disadvantage of David Cameron and unleashing the ""Cleggmania"" that now seems so long ago .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On election night, I was aboard the boat in the Thames hired by the BBC .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Among those also present to comment on the results was Michael Ashcroft, the Tory donor and pollster .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As it became clear that his party had failed to secure a majority , he placed the blame on the TV debates .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That view has since become orthodoxy in the Conservative party .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whether it is entirely true or not , it has been engraved into the Tory soul .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two people were very badly burnt: Mr Cameron himself and George Osborne , who ran the last Tory election campaign and was widely castigated by his colleagues for agreeing to the debates .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chancellor long ago told friends that he is not going to make the same mistake twice .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lynton Crosby, the prime minister's Australian strategist, is also dead-set against TV debates .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Craig Oliver, the Number 10 communications chief who has been leading the Tory side in the debate negotiations , is another key figure who believes it is all downside for them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first reason that David Cameron and his advisers are against debates is the traditional one .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He doesn't want to concede equality of status to his opponents .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The experience of the Clegg-Farage debates during the Euro elections hardened the belief in Number 10 that debates are bad for incumbents and a gift to challengers .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The view around Mr Cameron is expressed by one close ally : ""If you are the incumbent , debates are heavily weighted in favour of the insurgents . It is a rigged game.""  It is not , as is often assumed, fear of Nigel Farage coming at him from the right that most worries the prime minister .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His biggest concern is giving a boost to Ed Miliband .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV debates are the Labour leader's best remaining opportunity to secure mass exposure to voters sceptical that he is up to being prime minister and get them to reconsider their view .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So poor are his personal ratings , Mr Miliband might only have to turn up and string together a few half-decent sentences and more people would think better of him .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The hope that their man could benefit by exceeding low expectations is why Labour is desperate for debates to happen .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which makes the Tories equally desperate for them not to happen .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Conservatives , as we saw last week with their ""dodgy dossier"" about Labour's spending plans , want to revert to an old-fashioned model of election in which the campaign is dominated by staged leaders' tours in which the prime minister wafts around the country looking presidential and morning news conferences designed, with a bit of help from their friends in the press , to shape the campaign to a Tory agenda .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, from the off, the Conservatives have done everything in their power to prevent TV debates from happening at this election .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The broadcasters and the other parties wanted to begin negotiations about the format last spring .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Tories stalled , saying they wouldn't start talking until October .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When the negotiations finally got under way , I am told, and by a variety of different sources , that the Conservatives were determined to block any progress toward agreement .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""At every stage, they sought to put obstacles in the way,"" says one source .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Another confirms : ""The Tories kept throwing spanners in the works."" According to a third : ""All the parties, including Ukip, took part in good faith except the Conservatives."" Last time around, ""a heads of agreement"" about the debates had been written by December .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This time around, we have got to mid-January and aren't even close to that .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last meeting was just before Christmas .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""We didn't get anywhere because of the Tories,"" says one source, an account that is again corroborated by others .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have learned that a meeting between the parties and the broadcasters was scheduled for the Thursday just gone .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was cancelled at the last minute by the Conservatives .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No new date has been set .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The prime minister's latest excuse for nobbling debates is that he won't do it unless the Greens are included .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I happen to agree that the Greens ought to be represented in one debate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is not much logic to Ofcom's recent preliminary recommendation that Ukip and the Lib Dems should be treated as ""major"" parties for the purposes of allocating airtime during the campaign, but not the Greens .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have been nip and tuck with the Lib Dems in the opinion polls and quite often done better .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have had representation in the House of Commons for longer than Ukip .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So I agree that it would be fair to include the Greens - and hoot with laughter to hear that argument coming out of the mouth of David Cameron .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When did he become obsessed with championing the rights of minority parties? Who knew he had such a passion to debate with Natalie Bennett? In the history of political excuses, this must go down as one of the most terrible .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By running away from debates , the Tories are taking some risk with their leader's reputation and sense of himself .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Says one senior government figure : ""Cameron doesn't like being called chicken.""  If the Cameron brand is supposed to be the strong and confident leader , why is he frit of debating Ed Miliband, a man the Tories keep telling us is hopelessly weak? Won't it simply look bad to deny TV debates to the voters? Yes, it will , but the Tories are calculating that any fuss will be short - lived, soon forgotten and, in the end , not that many voters will punish them for it , especially if their spinners can successfully sow confusion about who is responsible .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Tories also bargain that the press won't make that big a deal of it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"About that, they may be right .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was resentment among newspapers during the last campaign that their capacity to shape the agenda was reduced by the TV debates .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are journalists and editors who will be secretly happy if they don't happen again .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As things stand , I think the chances of TV election debates happening are somewhere between zilch and nada .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Could anything change that? Some suggest that the broadcasters should call David Cameron's bluff and threaten to stage debates without him - ""empty chair"" him in the jargon .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Labour and the Lib Dems hope this will happen .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Number 10 is assuming that the BBC wouldn't have the nerve , the other broadcasters will follow its lead , and holding a debate without Mr Cameron might anyway be a breach of the laws about election coverage .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A debate between everyone but the prime minister could even suit the Tories when they want to project him as the statesman floating above the fray .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A more realistic way to flush him out would be to strip him of the Green figleaf he is using as his pretext for not debating .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The broadcasters could redraft their proposal to include Natalie Bennett in one of the debates .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip could say that they'd be content for her to participate .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think they would .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Labour and the Lib Dems aren't keen on including the Greens , who have been taking votes off both of them , but when it comes to the crunch , they'd rather have a debate with the Greens than no debates at all .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even then, the Tories are so determined to avoid TV debates that they'd most likely concoct another pretext for sabotaging them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel less certain about another survey this week, by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, conducted on social media , which claimed that 54% of British Jews feel they have no future in the UK .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Only two months previously this same reporter, in an on-air discussion about Miliband losing Jewish support, said : ""A lot of these prominent Jewish faces will be very much against the political mansion tax, presumably.""

This is right and good .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But can we take a few minutes to look at the lash itself, as well as dealing with the backlash?

"Thus in a way Stalin was the first Holocaust denier , even if his antisemitism was not quite the same as that of the Nazis .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was probably based more on a xenophobic suspicion of international connections than on racial hatred .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soviet propaganda , while designating those killed at Auschwitz in collectively anonymous terms as ""victims of fascism"" , also portrayed the extermination camp as the ultimate capitalist factory , where the workers were murdered when no longer useful .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And there was a further twist away from the truth .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Stalinists emphasised how many Poles had died there to distract attention from their own crimes against the Polish people, both following the Red Army's unprovoked invasion in 1939 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and its brutal occupation from 1944 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They portrayed Auschwitz as the place of martyrdom for the Polish nation .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By talking only of the Polish Catholics who had died there , they hoped that the Poles might focus any anger at their bitter fate entirely against Germany and not against the Soviet Union .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Few Poles were taken in during those postwar years of Soviet oppression .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And now Putin's ill-disguised attempts to reassert Russian control over Ukraine have of course reminded the Polish people all too clearly of what Soviet ""liberation"" meant for them in 1945 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is not therefore surprising that we should be seeing a certain amount of diplomatic shadow-boxing in the background , while both sides insist everything is normal .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Kremlin is pretending not to have been snubbed by the fact that President Putin has not been asked to the commemoration event ; meanwhile ,  the Polish government insists it was not issuing formal invitations .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This week a court in Belgium announced that the convicted rapist and murderer Frank Van Den Bleeken would be put to death by a lethal injection, in spite of the fact that the death penalty is banned across Europe .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Van Den Bleeken's case was unusual : having previously been declared insane and not criminally responsible , he had himself asked to be euthanised on the grounds that he would rather die than spend the rest of his life in jail .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today the Belgian justice minister announced that Van Den Bleeken would not be euthanised after all, amid reports that the prisoner had changed his mind .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nonetheless ,  the case provides a fascinating twist to the old debate about euthanasia .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Should Van Den Bleeken have been allowed to die?  The moral defence of voluntary euthanasia is usually applied to people suffering from a terminal illness .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But Van Den Bleeken isn't terminally ill and isn't in physical pain .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another traditional requirement is that the wish to die should be voluntary and competent .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But how can the choices of someone who has been declared insane be regarded as voluntary and competent? The concern is that granting his request would make it a case of involuntary euthanasia , and that is usually seen as morally unacceptable .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If there is an issue about Van Bleeken's sanity that is because of his alleged inability to control his sexual impulses .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it could be argued that this doesn't affect the validity of his request to be euthanised .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The implication is that while some of his decisions might be involuntary or incompetent , this doesn't apply to his choice of death over a lifetime behind bars .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even so , should his request have been granted , given that he isn't terminally ill? One argument for allowing voluntary euthanasia where terminal illness isn't an issue turns on the idea of wellbeing : people should be allowed to choose death where they would literally be better off dead or where their life literally isn't worth living .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another argument turns on human autonomy : we should respect a person's free choices as long as they don't harm anyone else .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Someone who is not terminally ill could still satisfy these requirements .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Had Van Den Bleeken been allowed to die , critics may say it would have risked opening the floodgates for other similar cases .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Belgium has seen a dramatic rise in euthanasia since the practice was legalised in 2002 and permitted in cases of pain and psychological distress, as well as terminal illness .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some are opposed to voluntary euthanasia as a matter of principle .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The philosopher David Velleman argues that there isn't a fundamental right to choose between life and death , and that a person's rights don't expand when they become terminally ill or psychologically distressed .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He is heavily influenced by 18th century philosopher Immanuel Kant .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to Kant , morality requires that we respect the dignity of persons , and the dignity of persons makes them intrinsically valuable .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Kant , a person's dignity can't be traded against their wellbeing or happiness , and the fact that a person believes that their life isn't worth living doesn't make it acceptable for them to be euthanised .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Van Den Bleeken case puts pressure on these standard arguments for and against voluntary euthanasia .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Suppose that, contrary to Kant's view, voluntary euthanasia is morally permissible as long as the person asking to be euthanised would be genuinely better off dead .",other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Relatives of Van Den Bleeken's victim may well argue that the fact (if it is a fact) that he would be better off dead is precisely a reason for not allowing him to be put to death .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From this perspective, euthanasia looks like a way for him to circumvent his sentence .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Van Den Bleeken's victim was Christiane Remacle, a 19-year-old he raped and strangled in 1989 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Her sisters are reported to have said that Van Den Bleeken should be forced to languish in jail , and their reaction brings out an ambivalence in how we think about the death penalty for murder .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Relatives of murder victims often demand the death penalty as the ultimate punishment , but the Van Den Bleeken case suggests that, at least from the standpoint of the perpetrator, the ultimate sanction may be life behind bars .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the intrinsic value argument against voluntary euthanasia can also be hard to swallow, in this case .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Christiane Remacle's sisters might balk at the idea that a murderer's life is intrinsically valuable .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's hard not to sympathise , and there remain strong reasons for not allowing Van Den Bleeken to be euthanised regardless of whether his life is intrinsically valuable .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As long as euthanasia is seen as a way for him to circumvent his sentence , respect for his victim and her family demands that he isn't given the option .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The longest and biggest oil boom in history is over .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a boom - and the latest one lasted almost 10 years - everything shines for producer nations : the economy grows , consumption explodes , businesses make fat profits regardless of their productivity , poverty declines even if social protection programmes are ineffective , politicians are popular and get re-elected even if they are incompetent and corrupt , and people tend to be happier .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But oil prices tend to be cyclical , so when the downturn comes , the party ends .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During the oil price decline of the 1980s, most oil-dependent countries suffered the consequences of the resulting collapse in investment and consumption .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A few, such as Oman and Malaysia, were able to compensate for the price collapse by increasing production , but many oil exporters suffered , also due to the production cuts agreed by Opec .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some recovered better than others , but in general between 1982 and 2002 they fared much more poorly than the rest of the developing world .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Those that fared worst were typically the ones that got into debt during the boom .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poverty and unemployment rose sharply .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  such underperformance led to the widespread idea that having oil is a curse , which has generated extensive literature .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The reality is more complex , as shown by economic overperformance during the past decade's boom .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact , taking out those two ""bust"" decades , oil countries have outperformed their peers over the past 70 years .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the real ""curse"" is in fact an oil price collapse .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The current price collapse - for the first time since 2009 prices are below the symbolic $50 a barrel - is largely a result of the boom in shale oil production in the US, adding more than 3m barrels over the past few years .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"High prices bring investment and supply , and this boom was no different .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oil prices are notoriously difficult to predict , so we do not know if the current bust will last , despite evidence that points to at least two more years of lower prices .",no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moreover ,  prices are still above historical standards .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the majority of the more than 120 years of history of the oil industry the price has been below $50 in today's money .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But geopolitics or renewed consumption could alter the oversupply scenario and surprise us once again .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  oil busts tend to lead to booms down the road precisely because investment in oil exploration dries up .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Net importers, like most European countries, will benefit from the oil price decline .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the US, citizens will pay significantly less for gasoline than they have over the past five years , leading them to spend more on other goods .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A vast transfer of wealth from exporters to importers is occurring .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even if the fall is short term , some pain will be suffered by all net oil exporters , but it will only be disastrous for the countries that failed to learn the lessons of the previous boom and bust cycle .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This time around many countries have saved a larger part of their windfall and invested more in productive assets, although generally significantly less than the value of the resource being depleted .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many abandoned their conservative fiscal policies during the financial crisis of 2008-09 , which made sense , but they never got back to the prudence of the first few years of the boom .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Middle Eastern producers were prompted to increase spending by the unrest produced by the Arab Spring .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Still ,  with few exceptions, most exporters are in better shape to weather the storm .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The wealthy countries of the Gulf, and some of the Caspian countries, can easily manage a temporary fall in prices  - they have accumulated large external funds , although some face more worrisome long- term fiscal prospects .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even Russia is in a better position to manage the oil fall than the Soviet Union was , but it would still suffer from the necessary cuts in imports and spending , and the sanctions will hurt more .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran is in worse shape because it had a less prudent economic policy and sanctions had already produced a crisis even before the fall in the oil price .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nigeria, despite an improved macro policy in comparison with the previous boom, is going to be significantly affected due to its excessive dependence on oil , leading to an increase in poverty and political instability .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Angola is also vulnerable .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Latin American oil exporters with generally prudent macro policies, like Colombia and Mexico, will also be affected by the necessary fiscal adjustment , but they should be able to manage it with limited trauma .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  no country is in worse shape entering into the price collapse than my home country, Venezuela .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the proverbial grasshopper of the fable, Venezuela did not only spend throughout the summer, mostly in consumption , but it also went into a debt binge to afford even more consumption : the country was running deficits of 15%-20% of GDP during the peak boom years .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now comes the winter and it faces economic collapse .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Inflation could top 100% in 2015 , shortages are widespread , and there is a high probability that many Venezuelans who came out of poverty during the boom will fall back into it, with serious consequences for political stability .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""What's up ,  bae?"" ""That's my bae,"" etc  , have been ways of staking claim and announcing intimacy between oneself and one's (sometimes prospective) lover .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bae is also used as a term of endearment and affection for someone with whom there is no romantic involvement or interest (not unlike ""honey"" or ""sweetheart"" is used in Southern dialogue) , as in ""Hey bae, can you pass me that plate?""  And then Pharrell put it in a song , Miley Cyrus did a cameo , and it gained the attention of mainstream media .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Suddenly there were articles attempting to define the word ""bae"" , otherwise reputable businesses began implementing ""bae"" in their social media ad campaigns , and everybody and they mama started using it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At which point it was declared overused by organs of upper-class white folk media like Time magazine .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fair enough: white people's adoption of the term distorted it to the point of misuse and meaninglessness .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What was once a word born of the beautifully eclectic black Southern laziness of the tongue and a shortened version of baby , became a catchall term for anything from inanimate objects to food .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The reference to affection was consistent but bae was used to describe everything from one's (desired or actual) significant other to pancakes .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""These cupcakes are bae"" , I read in a Facebook post attached to a picture of a delicious-looking dessert not many months later .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Cultural appropriation at its best, steals, reduces, overuses and then disposes of words like so much bathwater .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The linguist Jane H Hill defines language appropriation as ""a type of complex cultural borrowing that involves a dominant group's 'theft' of aspects of a target group's language."" Hill claims that the 'theft' adds value to white identity while further marginalizing nondominant groups .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This cultural ""borrowing"" of black language and phraseology happens regularly , allowing non-black folk to ""try on"" black culture through the use of African American English vernacular and slang without having to ""put on"" the cultural consequences of actually being black in a culture conditioned to devalue and dismiss it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Hill claims, language appropriation is further problematic because it gives dominant groups control over the language .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dominant groups get to decide, for example , when and if certain words are worth appropriation , when and how the words should be used , and then when the word becomes cliche, overused and therefore passe .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And often in the process , as happened with ""bae"" , the dominant group ends up changing the meaning or pronunciation of words entirely .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The good news is that black language is resilient and black folk are creative .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So even when the dominant culture tries to dispose of the terms it wears out , other words and phrases will emerge .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's been over twenty years since then - Bikini Kill frontwoman and Riot Grrrl icon Kathleen Hanna scrawled the word SLUT across her stomach .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the years since, there's been a book called Slut! , countless feminist debates over the reclamation of the word ""slut"" and, in 2011, thousands of women took to streets across the globe in anti-rape marches called SlutWalks - a reference to how victims of sexual assault are often blamed for the violence done to them .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like ""cunt"" and ""bitch"", many feminists have long tried to wrest away from its original users the power and harm of the word ""slut"" and to give it new meaning .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Increasingly, though, it's seeming like we might not succeed any time soon .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Take Leora Tanenbaum : in 2000, she wrote Slut! : Growing up Female with a Bad Reputation chronicling girls' and women's experiences with the word .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She herself was called a ""slut"" as a high school student in the 1980s - long before the term ""sexual harassment"" was coined - and told me ""I had no vocabulary to understand what happened.""  Now ,  15 years later, Tanenbaum is about to publish another book : I Am Not a Slut because , in part, the sheen of reclaiming ""slut"" seems to have worn off over the years .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When she spoke to women who called themselves ""sluts"" with a ""positive and defiant"" spirit , all told her the decision had turned against them later - and all regretted it .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tanenbaum told me that , when women are in closed circle or close-knit community - like a protest with like-minded people, or among friends who understand the cheeky appropriation of the word  - identifying as a ""slut"" can be empowering .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But what inevitably happens, especially in today's digital culture where revenge porn, stolen pictures and cyber harassment is the norm , is that ""it always spills outwards.""  For them it was an amazing feminist experience , but it didn't last .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Every single person I spoke to who intentionally embraced a ""slut"" persona ended up being treated terribly by people outside of her circle , because the culture we live in is so dominated by the sexual double standard .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But beyond women who tried to reclaim ""slut"" for themselves , other feminists have rightfully asked why we should all try to reclaim a word with so much baggage - especially a word that impacts different women differently, and brings them a lot more pain than righteous justice .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SlutWalks, for example, are no longer the cause celebre they once were because some women of color spoke out against the ways in which the protests and the reclamation of ""slut"" focused on the ability of white women to simultaneously embrace the word and reject its meaning .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A group of black female academics, activists, and writers wrote an open letter explaining that ""as Black women, we do not have the privilege or the space to call ourselves 'slut' without validating the already historically entrenched ideology and recurring messages about what and who the Black woman is.""  Rutgers professor and writer Brittney Cooper wrote at the time , ""To organize a movement around the reclamation of a term is in and of itself an act of white privilege.""
