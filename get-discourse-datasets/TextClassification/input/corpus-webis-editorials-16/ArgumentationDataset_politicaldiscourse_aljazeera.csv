"On Thursday, the so-called London Conference on Afghanistan will convene .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of all the high-profile international conferences that have been held on Afghanistan over the years - in Bonn, Tokyo, and Istanbul - this comes at a crucial juncture .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the end of October, British forces lowered the flag at Camp Bastion - from where they had engaged in the most intense fighting the British army had seen since the Falklands War - and handed over the base to Afghan forces .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"What explains this spate of violence, and is it a portent for the future of Afghanistan?  The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a US-led group that includes NATO members and others , winds up its mission on New Year's Eve .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A slimmed-down force of 12,000 foreign troops - mostly American - will stay behind , and US President Barack Obama has authorised the US contingent to continue supporting Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) throughout 2015 , with all of these forces scheduled to leave by the end of 2016 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US is not, therefore , leaving Afghanistan in the abrupt manner than it left Iraq in 2011 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But this is a time of dramatic change .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drastic effects on casualties .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For one thing ,  the ANSF are doing much of the fighting themselves, with drastic effects on casualties : over 9,000 Afghan troops have died since 2013, four times greater than the entire American death toll since 2001 .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Afghan police officers are suffering especially badly, with thousands being killed every month .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the political level, a new government of national unity, led by President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, has taken charge after Hamid Karzai's departure .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ghani is already reported to have opened backchannel talks with the Taliban , visiting both Pakistan and Beijing to seek their help in this effort , cancelling an earlier arms request from India, and even making a highly unorthodox visit to Pakistan's army headquarters , in recognition of Pakistan's long-standing support for the insurgents .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the ground, the overall picture is mixed .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This year, Taliban-initiated attacks are reported to have fallen by 25 percent , and ANSF mounted offensives four to five times more frequently than last year .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the same time , as political scientist Jason Lyall observed , the recently-concluded fighting season - from April to October - ""witnessed the appearance of large Taliban units on the battlefield"" for the first time, with a tenth of all Afghan districts seeing ""at least one major Taliban offensive"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lyall also notes reports of over 1,000 insurgents on the battlefield , ""numbers not seen since the Taliban's original push to capture Kabul during the 1992-96 civil war"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While we should take these reports with a pinch of salt - NATO commanders accuse their Afghan counterparts of exaggerating - they do point to a simple, stark fact : The insurgency is far from broken , and it will be able to pressure the Afghan state for years to come .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this context, the wave of insurgent attacks might be explained in several ways .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  these attacks might be intended to drive a wedge between the Afghan government and its foreign patrons , encouraging the latter to abandon their allies more quickly .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a Taliban spokesman put it bluntly : ""Our objective is to force the foreigners to flee Kabul . Before ,  the foreigners were visible in the provinces . Now that they have limited more of their activities to Kabul , we have also gone to Kabul to target them there."" To some extent, this has worked .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many aid agencies have pulled out their staff, and restricted their movements .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tarnished credibility .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second ,  the insurgents failed to seriously disrupt either round of this year's Afghan elections , as they had vowed to do , leaving their credibility somewhat tarnished .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prominent attacks - publicised with videos - redress this issue, and project strength at the end of a fighting season .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They might also be ways of strengthening the insurgency's bargaining position in advance of any peace talks that gain momentum over the next year .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Third , the insurgency is not a monolith , and different parts of the Taliban might be responsible for different attacks .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Haqqani Network, a semi- autonomous group with close ties to Pakistani intelligence, has proven most effective at projecting suicide bombings into Kabul .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Haqqanis were blamed for the most deadly atrocity of the past month, the bombing of a volleyball game in which over 50 Afghans were killed .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the past, moves towards dialogue between the Afghan government and the Taliban have been met with carefully targeted attacks intended less to strengthen bargaining positions than to disrupt such talks altogether .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whatever the explanation , Afghanistan faces an extremely test period .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although the presence of US forces provides a safety net throughout next year , things look more precarious after that .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"International funding commitments for Afghanistan currently run to 2017 , but that timeline had assumed the insurgency would lose steam by then , allowing ANSF to slim down .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If that isn't possible , the annual $4-6bn bill for the security forces is simply unsustainable .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This week's London Conference is an opportunity to secure much greater contributions from regional powers , who have the most at stake if Afghanistan does fall apart once more .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China is, for instance, one of the world's largest economies, a direct neighbour of Afghanistan, and a significant investor there .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But if Beijing is unwilling to offer more than a meagre $327m - nearly half the amount Iran pledged in 2012, and far less than Japan or the EU - then how are western governments, with their attention directed to threats from Russia and ISIL , supposed to persuade their own public that, after a decade of war, Afghanistan must stay on financial life-support?",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The London Conference on Afghanistan will provide an opportunity for the government of Afghanistan to set out its commitment to reform,"" states the UK government's official webpage of the upcoming meeting between the new Afghan government and its international donors .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The conference is also an opportunity for the international community ""to reaffirm its long-term commitment to supporting Afghanistan's peaceful development"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the media hype, the London Conference is nothing more than a routine reunion, set by the 2012 Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF) .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As part of the agreement, donors pledged support and the Afghan government promised to implement reforms and curb corruption .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The upcoming meeting in the British capital, therefore, is the first in a series of exchanges that will be held every two years, at the ministerial level, between the Afghan and donor governments to assess progress and check TMAF's benchmarks .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Still ,  the December 4 conference has the potential to ease Afghanistan into a stable and increasingly self-sufficient future and render it a reliable global partner for ensuring peace and stability in the region and beyond .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To utilise this opportunity as more than a routine progress assessment requires a fundamental shift of attitude on both sides .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lack of concrete success in the military, economic development and governance efforts in post - Taliban Afghanistan needs to be sincerely examined and adjustments need to be made .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is multitude of examples in the international community's flawed, if not disingenuous, aid programmes and their monitoring in Afghanistan .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was hired by a US consultancy firm to map out the field and offer recommendations for the design of a multimillion dollar governance project .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My report and recommendations , it turned out , were too radical .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""We expected recommendations for cosmetic changes to the ongoing programmes,"" I was told .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The donor agency does not want to rock the boat.""  On another occasion, I was interviewed by a European consultant for his assessment of the first phase of a programme that had consistently been showcased as a ""success story"" by donors and the Afghan government .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In his three-day field trip to Kabul, he had held meetings with three embassies, the UN, the Afghan head of the implementing agency and me .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eagerly, I began to point to the flaws of the programme and offered suggestions for improvement .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also offered assistance for site visits .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Do n't waste your time and mine,"" the septuagenarian consultant told me .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The donor agency expects a rosy report highlighting only the positive.""  He further clarified that the decision to fund the second phase had already been made and it had more to do with international aid politics, than development logic .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Numbers provide an easy way to illustrate success , especially when seeking international aid budget approval from legislative bodies .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While figures indicating Afghanistan's progress towards development are impressive and could not have been achieved without generous international assistance , they conceal a lack of attention to quality .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
About 8 million Afghan children - including over 2.5 million girls - are now in school .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a figure cited regularly as an indication that the programmes are yielding tangible results .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fact that most of them graduate only half-literate is never revealed .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Here's another feel-good figure : More than 60 percent of the Afghan population now has access to healthcare facilities .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The fact that some of those facilities have only received a checkmark because merely a building was constructed and many are staffed only with a nurse, have no diagnostic technology and have terribly anaemic pharmaceutical offerings is often ignored .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Much has been written about the fact that a hefty portion of the aid money goes back to donor countries because of the donors' insistence to award contracts to their own citizens .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The contracts move hand to hand and finally local non-governmental agencies are hired to implement projects .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At this point , while at best one-quarter of the original funds remains to be spent on the actual project , quality is grossly compromised and monitoring becomes either too complex or irrelevant .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The international community has also created an indigenous vehicle for channelling portions of its assistance .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Under the guise of ""civil society"", hundreds of Afghan NGOs have been established since 2002 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This artificial civil society's lifeline is the donor community in Kabul .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Projects and funds are handed to them for implementation and as the closing of fiscal year in donor capitals approaches, generosity in disbursing funds, irrespective of the projects' logic, utility and cost increases .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where the funds go .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Granted that when international aid began to pour in , the Afghan state had very small , if any , capacity to absorb and spend it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  after 13 years and millions of dollars spent on public sector capacity building, the bulk of the funds continue to be spent directly by donors and only a little over 20 percent is given to the Afghan government .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The parallel system and structures offering higher salaries paid in US dollars have lured much of the skilled Afghan human resources .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Afghan administration, thus, has to be grateful to donors for funding training workshops , while in the end, loses its best trained personnel to international organisations, consulting firms and embassies .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is often said that rampant Afghan corruption and lack of capacity would result in misuse and waste of donors' funds .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A mere review of reports published by the US oversight agency, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), reveals the depth and extent of waste, fraud and abuse of the direct US aid to Afghanistan just in reconstruction projects .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similar monitoring of most donors' direct aid will, no doubt, highlight comparable corruption and waste .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The government of former President Hamid Karzai admittedly failed to launch a genuine fight against corruption .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lack of capacity for a governance vision that would make optimum use of international aid was also a defect of the previous leadership .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"High-level appointments were based not on competence and commitment of individuals, but rather on political affiliations and compromises on the one hand, and submissiveness of a handful of ""yes sir"" entities on the other .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thus ,  both sides - donors and the Afghan government - went on for a decade playing a futile blame game , each accusing the other of corruption and insincerity .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now ,  on the eve of the London Conference, a new page has turned in Afghanistan's leadership and governance .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The level of optimism among ordinary Afghans is only comparable to the euphoria of the first weeks following the fall of the Taliban regime .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This renewed domestic hope and confidence in the new leadership must not be let to deflate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although the new administration has not yet launched its overhauling programme , President Ashraf Ghani's vision and capacity is well known .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Donors at the London Conference must seize the chance and afford him confidence .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They must also adapt a fundamentally new approach to dispensing their generous assistance to Afghanistan .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A significant funnelling of international aid through the Afghan government (with oversight and accountability benchmarks), a shift of emphasis from quantity to quality, with particular focus on raising the quality of education and finally , a sincere commitment from both sides to the establishment of rule of law will ensure the stability and eventual self-reliance of Afghanistan .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"After 13 years of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the United States and a number of its NATO partners will start the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The number of NATO and US forces is reduced from 140,000 to 13,500  - most of them American - starting January 1 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How will the new national unity government in Kabul weather the NATO drawdown, despite a resilient insurgency and intensified fighting?  There has been much speculation about the security transition in 2014 in Afghanistan .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2012, I wrote an Oped for the New York Times , warning that ""Kabul risks political meltdown"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many other analysts have also predicted a sombre year , particularly after the refusal of former President Hamid Karzai to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) with the US .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  for the time being, we were all proved wrong as the democratic process that began at the Bonn Conference in 2001 , survived , and the country was saved from the brink of a new civil war .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed we have achieved important strategic gains in the last few months , starting with the landmark peaceful transfer of political power from one democratically elected leader to another, for the first time in Afghanistan's history .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This milestone was made possible by the will of ordinary Afghan people , who twice braved the threat of violence imposed by the Taliban and came out en masse , voting for their candidates of choice .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile ,  the Taliban has tried hard to undermine the electoral process .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By confronting Afghan security forces in 16 different provinces , they wanted to gain significant territory , thus declaring themselves as an alternative governing force in the country .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nevertheless ,  the Afghan security forces have been able to hold ground and push back the insurgent offensives in almost all fronts , which has became a source of pride for the Afghan government and people .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This proved wrong skeptics who doubted the capacity of the Afghan security forces to defend their country , which has taken responsibility for security in many provinces since the start of the security transition in 2012 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Following the inauguration of President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Abdullah Abdullah, the BSA was immediately signed, approved by an overwhelming majority of Afghan Members of Parliament .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to the BSA, the signing of the Status of Force Agreement (SOFA) between NATO and the new Afghan government has created a new momentum in the country , while ensuring continued military and financial assistance for the new government .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This has inherited an economic crisis, characterised by a fiscal gap resulting from the failures of the previous government .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Afghanistan's strategic gains are still contingent upon two important factors .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, there must be continued NATO support for the Afghan security forces .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is done by building the capacity of the forces ; providing adequate resources such as fire power and particularly air power ; assisting in intelligence gathering ; and logistics support .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Without the technical and financial support from the US and NATO countries, the Afghan security forces will not be able to sustain a high rate of casualties against the Taliban .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For instance in 2014, an additional 5,000 members of the Afghan security forces were killed either in direct fighting against the Taliban or because of terrorist attacks such as suicide and road side bombings .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondly, the government has the capacity to reform the security intuitions in order to reduce the level of corruption and eliminate political influence exercised by important power brokers .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The financing of the Afghan security forces are beyond the Afghan government's resources and is totally dependent on donors' contribution .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The government could make significant contributions by reducing costs .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This could be done through reducing corruption and improving management .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile ,  eliminating political influence in appointments of senior officials and promotion of officers could boost the morale of the security forces and increase their fighting capacity .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alas, despite tremendous strategic gains, the new National Unity Afghan government is struggling with key cabinet appointments, particularly in the security sector , which might have been caused by heavy political influence by power brokers .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  failures inherited from the previous government such as bad governance, corruption, nepotism and many other symptoms that have caused a growing popular resentment, remain a serious threat to the national unity government .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While people admit that improvements in the security and economic sectors require time , they will not tolerate any failure in fixing a dysfunctional government which has failed to address endemic corruption and a culture of impunity .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The inability of the new national unity government to implement a comprehensive reform agenda , could undermine the security transition .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is clear to us in Afghanistan that the donor countries will not tolerate anymore corruption and bad governance , which could weaken their financial commitments pledged during the NATO Summit in Wales .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Any reduction in funding for the Afghan government could negatively impact the Afghan security forces , while the Taliban will increase their offensive .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The biggest test for the security transition is ahead of us because the insurgents will further intensify their attacks in the beginning of next spring and we might see a Taliban surge next summer .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Afghan government has little time to prepare itself for the upcoming fighting season , which has impacted the US and NATO military missions in Afghanistan since 2001 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls has said that his country is now at war with radical Islam .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""It is a war against terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam, against everything that is aimed at breaking fraternity, freedom, solidarity,"" Valls said during a speech on Saturday in Evry, south of Paris .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What is ""radical Islam""? Is there such a thing? And how does this affect the ongoing US-led war on extremism - the most tangible form being ISIL who have controlled large segments of land and people in northern Iraq and eastern Syria?  Very few people know that in Islam there are two kinds of ""jihad"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The smaller jihad is the more known - namely the one which reflects the military struggle .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the greater jihad , which is less known , is the internal jihad - or struggle .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Few people also know that the Arabic word ""jihad"" is used throughout the Bible as well , although certainly not in the militaristic sense .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 Timothy 4:7 states : ""I have fought the good fight , I have finished the race , I have kept the faith."" The verse in Arabic uses the term ""jihad"" for the word ""fight"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So whether it is this struggle or the fight for a better world , the militaristic jihad is certainly not a monopoly for Islamists .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
World leaders have correctly pointed out that the fight against ISIL must be waged both on the military and ideological levels .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But we must be careful about the idea of conflating Islam with radicalism .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People and ideas might be radical but to target a religion with radicalism adds insult to injury and shifts from the proper focus which is the individually created extremism .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We have heard and seen a lot of the former , but very little has been done to tackle the ideologies behind this extreme group .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The need to deal with the extreme thoughts connected to this movement was made clear by extremists who carried out the heinous attack against a French satirical newspaper; most likely because of the ideas it has espoused .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whenever violent acts take place , the natural response is to militarily obliterate the group or militia behind it .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There might be a good case for a military response but it would be a totally counterproductive effort if it is not accompanied by an equally strong ideological response .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It might be possible to kill the holders of some of these ideas but everyone knows that you can't kill ideas by using force .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extremist ideology must be tackled in a number of ways .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most important ideological response to extremism is the need to show that there are better and more effective ways to deal with the various issues that make extremism popular .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This includes the need to introduce real political reform in the countries that are of importance to the people that follow these extreme leaders .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It applies both to the Arab countries whose autocratic leadership has left a large sector of the public without any say in what happens to them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it also applies to the need to continue stemming racism and Islamophobia from many of the western countries where some homegrown terrorism seems to be gaining strength .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The issue is complicated by murderous acts like those committed in Paris , which tend to increase rather than decrease anti-Islamic sentiments .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to political changes that must be introduced , Arab and Muslim intellectuals and leaders must end their self-imposed silence and speak out clearly and unabashedly .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no reason to keep repeating that these actions are not a reflection of true Islam .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is needed is for writers and thinkers to produce concrete and practical thoughts and ideas that can be applicable to the 21st century .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today's Arab and Muslim youth need to find alternative role models and alternative ideas that they can adopt in this struggle of ideas that extremists are working tirelessly to defend - and to which the other side is only paying lip service .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One successful idea called takween (seen on the local Jordanian website, ammannet.net) has seen an increase in audience as reformed independent writers from various backgrounds (culture, media, women's issues and workers rights) are producing daily analysis that is the anti-thesis to ISIL's ideology .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The individual efforts by some intellectuals is to be supported but much more is necessary .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The anti-extremism military effort can't yield positive results if there isn't a combined change in how ruling governments conduct their affairs (especially on the economic empowerment front) , and how to tackle every one of the extremists' thoughts, ideas and practices .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The battle will be long and cumbersome but in order to win , all people of good will must work together to produce what is good and uplifting for a better future for all .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Many have simply lost faith in global climate negotiations summits such as COP 20 starting in Lima, Peru today .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But while the process has not delivered the climate action we need , I would argue that this year key things have changed and that we must continue to demand from our politicians that they listen and act and, by that, safeguard the future of next and current generations on this planet .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As nations start the latest global round of climate change negotiations in Lima, Peru today , it is easy to be cynical .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because in the 20 plus years that our governments have been meeting for global climate meetings , emissions have risen more than ever before .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The largest ever climate march in New York this September was a powerful symbol for the global rise of a movement that is stopping pipelines and coal plants as well as forcing renewable energy solutions all over the world .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In economics , too ,  we live in a different world : Cost-effective, sensible renewable energy solutions have made quantum leaps .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Renewables are the most economical solution for new power capacity in an ever-increasing number of countries .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bilateral agreement .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And yet it did .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only a fool would argue that the action proposed by these two biggest polluters and biggest economies is enough .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is not enough , experts have already told us , to protect our planet from a potential three or four degree Celsius rise in global temperatures - with all the disastrous consequences that would have for us, our children, and our ecosystems .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the fact that the world's biggest emitters have come together moves us from a ""you go first"" mentality , that had paralysed global climate negotiations for years, to an ""I will act if you will act"" frame .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At Lima , others must now follow and our pressure must speed up the action .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because we need an agreement to tackle the climate crisis , which meets the needs of the many not the few .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because it is ordinary people living in flood and drought prone areas, dependent for their livelihoods on fishing, farming and forests, or living in cities engulfed by pollution or in housing that cannot protect them from storms or heat waves , who are bearing the brunt of our experiment with the world's climate .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The United Nations  - where every country has a voice, not matter how small, relatively poor or vulnerable - are still the only place where we can hope to secure action that takes full account of these peoples' rights .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At Lima, we need governments to make sure that the direction is right .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They need to agree a goal of ending carbon pollution and deliver renewable energy for all people on this planet by 2050 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And in Lima, governments must agree to renew and review their targets every five years, starting in 2025 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not just to cut pollution, but to help the vulnerable adapt to climate change, and to support poorer countries to provide sustainable energy access for their populations .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Every government should already be preparing their ""intended nationally determined contribution"" - their offer towards the Paris deal .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before March 2015 we must see concrete, ambitious plans from each and every one of the world's polluting nations  - to phase out coal and nuclear power , to install solar and wind energy , to increase energy efficiency, to build cleaner and more livable cities, and to protect forests .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Lima, governments must agree to review whether these plans are enough to prevent climate chaos and whether the effort is shared fairly between richer and poorer nations before they meet again in Paris in December 2015 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Lima, we expect scientists, business people and investors, city mayors, faith leaders and civil society organisations from all over the world to be calling for more ambitious climate action .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Argentina has chosen a certain path for development that is diametrically opposed to what is required to mitigate the problems of climate change .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And as Argentinean representatives attend the Climate Change Summit in Peru , it's worth looking at its poor environmental record .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Average temperature in the southern region of Patagonia has increased one degree Celsius in the last 50 years , provoking the retreat of the largest glaciers in the region .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During the same period, rains increased by 10 percent in the east ; severe flooding in northeastern Argentina has been linked to the change in the use of the land and the deterioration of local ecosystems .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New challenge .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More specifically, this new challenge to Armenia's traditional reliance on Russia is driven by two significant factors: tragedy and timing .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A tragedy first triggered this turnabout when a rogue Russian soldier killed an entire Armenian family , save for a six-month-old infant who later died of his stab wounds, in Gyumri, Armenia .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gyumri is the country's second-largest city and the host of the Russian military base .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That senseless act of random violence in the early morning hours of January 12, sparked an immediate and spontaneous outpouring of grief and mourning .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the initial shock and grief quickly turned to outrage , as Russian military officials seemed to take charge of the case with a heavy-handed disdain and disregard for local sensitivities .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That perception was only deepened when Armenian officials were slow to respond or react .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was this mishandling of the tragedy , even more than the murder itself, that then triggered a series of demonstrations and protests by local Armenians in Gyumri .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fearing that the Russian conscript would be moved from his detention within the Russian base and likely returned to Moscow , local residents demanded that the self-confessed soldier be turned over to Armenian authorities .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Calming tensions .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Amid the Armenian officials' wrangling over the legal process of the case, the absence of any higher level Armenian officials, and the failure of the Armenian president to declare a day of mourning or even make a statement , only escalated the tension .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And days later , no Armenian official attended the funeral of the murdered family , thereby triggering a fresh wave of indignant protests in the city , that later spread to the capital, Yerevan .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The protests soon moved to the Russian consulate in Gyumri before culminating in a march on the Russian base as protesters broke through a police cordon to enter the base itself .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  there is a deeper context to this public anger .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  that family is only the latest victim in murders and shootings by Russian servicemen stationed at the Russian military base .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bad timing .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Against this backdrop, the tragedy has also raised renewed questions of base security, with outrage that the armed soldier who reportedly deserted his post triggered no notice or alarm by Russian military personnel at the base .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although this tragedy has prompted a new challenge to Armenian-Russian relations , it is also exacerbated by a second factor, timing .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The timing of this tragedy could not be much worse, for several reasons .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  in 2013 , in what many perceived as Russian pressure on its so-called ""strategic partner"" , Armenia was forced to scrap its planned free trade deal with the European Union in favour of joining the Russian-led Eurasian Union .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second ,  a steady supply of arms and advanced weapons systems to Azerbaijan from Russia has sowed further distrust .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current blame game is meaningless .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Politicians do have a higher degree of responsibility to bring a nation out of the political mess , but one should not forget that they originate from the society and carry its values, norms and culture .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The brutal events in Paris have sparked another conversation across global media on the scourge of Islamic terrorism and led the Independent's Middle East correspondent, Patrick Cockburn, to suggest that people forget about overthrowing Assad and instead should concentrate on building a common cause with Damascus that ""could unite against violent Sunni jihadism"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However , while Assad is still there nominally in power , a closer look reveals that he is more marginalised than ever and an increasingly irrelevant political actor on a stage dominated by others .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This authoritarian facade must be taken into account in future policy towards the beleaguered country .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Garner screamed that he couldn't breathe but despite his protests police continued to hold his neck in order to handcuff him , and when it became apparent that he had stopped breathing , the four EMTs on the scene made no effort to revive him .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This entire episode was caught on video by a friend of Garner's and its viral spread helped spur New York authorities to actually convene a grand jury of 25 New York citizens .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The grand jury, however, decided that despite the visual evidence, and despite the city coroner declaring Garner's death a homicide , that there was not enough evidence to warrant a full trial .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thousands of Americans of all ages and colours took to the streets in a series of spontaneous protests across the country .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's easy from the outside to look at these protests and assume that this is a dangerous and destabilising tipping point ; that there is a new wave of violence against minorities that has finally reached a point of no return .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While African Americans only make up 13 percent of the population they account for over 30 percent of all police killings in 2012 alone .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When you combine this kind of history with racial discrimination in sentencing, arrests, fines, jail time , where African Americans routinely receive longer, harsher and less lenient penalties than whites for the same crimes , it is hard to simply say that the cases of Eric Garner (or Michael Brown, or Tamir Rice or John Crawford) are new or isolated incidents .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US criminal justice system isn't broken , it's working exactly the way it was intended to work , and it was never written, implemented or designed to provide justice or equality for African Americans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However what is different in this case is that it's not just African Americans protesting , a significant number of white, Latino and Asian Americans have flooded the streets of New York protesting the Garner ruling, shutting down major highways, malls and even disrupting the annual Christmas tree lighting .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At its core, police violence is a white American problem, not a black one .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"On Monday, he convened a commission of civil rights leaders and unveiled plans to put more shoulder cameras on police officers' uniforms and thoroughly review Programme 1033 , which allows local police departments to get free access to surplus military equipment .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And while those are fine first steps , neither would have saved Garner's life or changed the decision of the grand jury .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The police did not have heavy militarised equipment but they employed a physical chokehold method that had been declared illegal by the New York police department for over 20 years , but that too wasn't enough to warrant a trial .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If consumer demand continues to grow , it will eventually result in downward pressure on oil exports and could start affecting subsidies .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Without a robust and efficient energy balance in the region, it will inevitably lead to these producer nations becoming less profitable with a weaker export outlook .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Shocking?  It's no more shocking that some Muslims have become psychotic enough to murder, rape and pillage their way across eastern Nigeria and eastern Paris than it is that France, home of ""liberty"", ""equality"", and ""fraternity"", sells billions of dollars of weapons and otherwise provides political and diplomatic support to countries that practice the polar opposite of all three ; that the US kills thousands of civilians with drones (and tens of thousands with conventional weapons) that are as merciless as the terrorists they presumably target ; that Israel kills 1,500 Palestinians with the complete acquiescence of the US and Europe ; or that most every Muslim government condemning the attack on Charlie Hebdo routinely imprisons and tortures artists and activists for far less offensive expression, all with the support of the West .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is only by uncritically adopting the hegemonic narrative of western liberalism that one could reach the conclusion that the biggest threats to freedom of expression in the world today are Islam and North Korea .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Even as they were establishing the very foundations of modern liberal societies, from the tenets of freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion to the basis for democratic forms of governance , Enlightenment thinkers were nearly universal in their expression of support for a world built on racial hierarchies and the expansion of new European empires that depended largely on the use of violence to control colonial subjects .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In the same way that western governments take great care to prevent the spread of ideas and messages they consider culpable for radicalising Muslims (all pretensions about freedom of expression be damned) , they should consider the role that anti-Muslim cultural production plays in facilitating their own abuses of human rights, and radicalising their own citizens , as seen in the wave of anti-Muslim terrorism that has witnessed a marked rise in the past decade .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If we don't create the space to say these things without casting those that do so as fanatical supporters of murder , then what is this limitless freedom of expression we keep insisting we are firmly on the side of?  The demand that we all respond in a mass, uniform way also makes a basic error about how unity works - which is to forget that it can only survive if there are spaces between us ; solidarity and common ground take hold because of the existence of a spectrum in thought and experience, and not despite these things .",par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In April 2009 , harrowing interviews with the 14 ""high-value detainees"", conducted by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, were leaked , and in August 2009 an internal CIA report from 2004 into the agency's detention and interrogation policies after 9/11 was released containing details of how one prisoner, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri (one of the three men waterboarded, along with Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Muhammad), was physically abused and threatened with a gun and power drill while hooded at a ""black site"" in Thailand .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2010 I wrote a detailed analysis of the secret detention programme for a UN study , in which I sought to ascertain the identities of the 94 ""ghost prisoners"" in CIA custody - including 28 subjected to ""enhanced interrogation""  - who were referred to in a memo from 2005 by OLC lawyer Steven G Bradbury that was released by the Obama administration in April 2009 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"And yet , although some of the gruesome facts about the torture programme were known , the Senate Intelligence Committee's report provides far more .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In its ""Findings and Conclusions"", for example, the report states :.  There are many more examples .",par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The report states :.  In addition , ""sleep deprivation involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours"" , and although some ""experienced disturbing hallucinations"", in at least two cases the CIA continued its abuse .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These examples - and many more in the summary - demonstrate clearly the committee's conclusion that the interrogations ""were brutal and far worse than the CIA represented to policymakers and others"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps more importantly, however, the committee also concludes that torture was ""not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees"" , that the CIA made ""inaccurate claims"" about the ""effectiveness"" of the programme in an attempt to justify it and that it led to friction with other agencies that endangered national security, as well as providing false statements that led to costly and worthless wild goose chases .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The report also concludes that non-approved techniques were used widely , and that ""[a]t least 17 detainees were subjected to CIA enhanced interrogation techniques without authorisation from CIA headquarters"" , and that ""multiple detainees were subjected to techniques that were applied in ways that diverged from the specific authorisation , or were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques by interrogators who had not been authorised to use them"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The committee was also critical of the central role played by two contract psychologists from the SERE programme , even though neither of them ""had any experience as an interrogator, nor did either have specialised knowledge of al-Qaeda, a background in counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The committee also concluded that Steven Bradbury's numbers were wrong , and that the CIA ""detained at least 119 individuals , of whom at least 39 were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moreover ,  of these 119 ""at least 26 were wrongfully held and did not meet the detention standard"" in the still-secret Bush administration memorandum establishing the programme in September 2001 .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the days and weeks to come , there will be concerted efforts by the CIA and by former Bush administration officials to defend their actions , but the report makes clear that any kind of defence is untenable .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was ugly .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It should lead no doubt to the reader that the programme was as wrong as it was useless .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And it can never be permitted to happen again .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The CIA's torture programme was authorised by then President George W Bush in August 2002 , giving them broad discretion in the use of harsh interrogation techniques that included waterboarding, sleep deprivation, hypothermia, stress positions, abdomen strikes, slapping and forced shaking .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its stated purpose was to solicit actionable intelligence that might save American lives .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abysmal failure .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nearly 500 pages in length , it was a mere, yet chilling, fraction of the overall report , which will remain classified .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the message was clear .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The torture programme, despite what its supporters claimed at the time, and continue to do so even now , was an abysmal failure and disgrace for the US .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In its very first finding , which set the stage for what was to follow , SSCI concluded the use of torture was not an ""effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And most disturbingly, right from the beginning, CIA officers routinely called into question the programme's effectiveness in producing accurate intelligence .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  their leadership turned a blind eye to those concerns , ignoring numerous internal critiques, criticisms and objections from those charged with carrying out the grisly day-to-day operations .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were even instances when interrogators were ordered to continue torturing certain detainees who they had already assessed as being cooperative .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is what we call a crisis in leadership - both at the CIA and at the highest levels of the Bush Administration .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Incredibly, of the 20 examples most often used by the CIA to show how successful their torture programme was , all were determined to be fundamentally wrong or misleading .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Case in point : In their representations to the White House, National Security Council, Department of Justice, Congress and the American people, the CIA often referred to Abu Zubaydah as ""proof"" that those methods provided real, actionable intelligence that saved American lives .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zubaydah, a senior al-Qaeda figure, was captured in Pakistan in March 2002 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Several months later , after the torture programme was authorised , he was subjected to numerous and repeated torture techniques , to include being waterboarded 83 times .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to former Bush Administration and CIA officials involved in the programme at the time, Zubaydah - as a direct result of his being waterboarded - not only provided information that allowed the FBI to disrupt the Jose Padilla ""Dirty Bomb Plot"" in Chicago , but also identified Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There' s only one problem with that story .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It wasn't true .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to the SSCI report, the FBI actually obtained that information from Zubaydah through legal interrogation techniques between March and June 2002, and provided it to the CIA months before he was ever subjected to waterboarding or any other torture techniques .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to the FBI interrogators, they had developed a rapport with Zubaydah , who was cooperating with them .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And yet ,  the CIA decided to subject him to torture .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can't .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Otherwise ,  they'll find themselves going back down that path again the next time fear and panic take hold .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fall of Mosul and the quick territorial expansion of ISIL in Iraq took some by surprise .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What contributed to ISIL's quick success was cooperation from local Sunni tribes and members of the traditionally secular and nationalist Baath party .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This seemingly counterintuitive alliance has its rationale and deep roots in history .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The successful cooperation between radical Islamist factions, Sunni tribes and representatives of the former ruling party - currently commanders of paramilitary groups - can be traced back to the policies of Saddam Hussein in the early 1980s , which aimed to foster closer ties between those espousing the ideas of political Islam and the Baath party .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The historical preconditions for the advent of Islamist ideas in Iraq and their eager adoption by Sunni resistance forces are clearly discernible in the strategy proposed at the time by the then Iraqi president .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1986, at a meeting with representatives of the pan-Arab national command - the supreme ideological body of the Baath Party - Saddam Hussein offered a ceasefire, or even an alliance, between the party and the Muslim Brotherhood movement in Egypt and Sudan .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In practice, for the first time in its history the militant and secular Baath party declared its readiness to cooperate with representatives of the so-called political Islam .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the same year, the Iraqi president also defined the difference between the ""democratic, national, pan-Arab state"" and the ""religious state"" proclaimed by the Muslim Brotherhood .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Following in the footsteps of the founding father of Arab nationalism and of the pan-Arab Baath party Michel Aflaq, Saddam clearly declared that he was not an atheist , but warned against any attempt to establish a religious party with an either Sunni or Shia bias .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Saddam's warning at the time was probably addressed at the Islamic Dawa party , which had a dominant role among the Shia community and was regarded as the main competitor of the Baath party .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The president also rejected the traditional Islamic system of justice and denounced Islamic law as an obsolete legal tradition .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was only after 1990s that Saddam decided to focus on relations with Islamic movements and publications dedicated to the topic began to appear in the media .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The conditions could not have been more favourable because the war with Iran had ended and the propaganda machine was busy painting a picture of Saddam as the indisputable victor , despite the enormous war-related losses .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1991, Iraq launched a new campaign , which Saddam described as ""the mother of all battles"" against the United States and its allies .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The president was yet again depicted as a hero in the confrontation between Muslims and western forces ; the inscription ""God is Great"" was added to the Iraqi flag , and the president promised that he would free Jerusalem .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An attempt was made to play down the failure of the campaign in Kuwait and the sanctions imposed by stepping up an openly pro-Islamic propaganda .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1993, under the weight of a crippling international embargo, the Iraqi president declared the beginning of the so-called religious campaign .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The goal was to gain control over religious sentiment among the Iraqi population , which was barely coping with the consequences of the two wars and the stringent sanctions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last but not least, an attempt was made to reinvent and soften the image of the Baghdad regime as one that is pro-Islamic and, therefore, in conflict with the ""forces of Islam's enemies"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The regime undertook demonstrative moves such as closing night clubs and some restaurants and enforcing restrictions on alcohol sales .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A large scale Quran studying campaign was undertaken .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Senior Sunni and Shia clerics took advantage of the situation and attempted to further the interests of their respective communities , declaring open support for the line taken by the Iraqi leader .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1998, top-ranking party officials, including Vice President Izzat Ibrahim al- Douri, were openly demonstrating religious piety and devotion .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The period after 1993 ushered in a renewed mosque building effort .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1989, a new religious university was founded and named after Saddam .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The influence of radical Sunni teachings increasingly gained prominence in certain intellectual circles within Baghdad University .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While one group openly espoused extreme conservative views , which today can be described as Salafi beliefs , the other blended in with the Sunni theosophical tradition and was influenced by the teachings of the Naqshbandiyya Order .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to witness testimonies, both groups received financial and moral support from the same source - Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A member of the academic community has even alleged that the vice president's support came with the blessing of Saddam .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The spread of the new ideology that lay at the very heart of the religious campaign began to make inroads into the judicial system , with the incorporation of extreme and previously unknown punishments into the body of law .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By way of example, according to Decree No 59/1994 theft became punishable by amputation .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The events that are currently unfolding in Iraq warrant the conclusion that the advent of ISIL and its support from or collaboration with Iraqi Sunni structures would have been impossible without the historical preconditions outlined above having already been firmly set in place .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki failed to strike a reasonable balance between the interests of all ethnic and religious groups in the country by systematically marginalising the Sunni community .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another important reason is widespread corruption and the lack of a concept and strategy for the development of the country on the basis of the established constitutional order that is shared by all groups in society .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From 2003 to date, no Iraqi government has initiated and proposed an adequate policy for Sunni inclusion .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The programme for the de-Baathificaton of senior-ranking party officials (whose number some commentators put at more than 40,000) has resulted in many losing their livelihood .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to its affiliation with the party, approximately one-third of the Iraqi population was effectively marginalised .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scores of people - many of them young people, including officers in Saddam's army and former civil servants - have been stripped of the Baathist ideology that they previously espoused and that had dominated their social life .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This void has been filled by Islam .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since 2004, many Iraqi Sunnis have joined the ranks of the Iraqi resistance movement , which brings together a number of prominent groups under its banner, such as the Naqshbandiyya Army, Al-Awda, Al-Qiyada al-Amma li Jaysh Al-Iraq (General Command of the Iraqi Army), Munazzamat al-Tahrir al-Iraqiya (Iraqi Liberation Organisation), Kataib Salah ad-Din (Salah al-Din Brigades), etc .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the radical narrative so typical for purely Islamic organisations, those mentioned continue to rely on the propaganda postulates formerly employed by Saddam as cornerstones of their public rhetoric .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The crisis in Iraq has much clearer outlines today than it did a year ago , largely due to the refusal of the government to consider Sunni demands .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has logically escalated with the advent of ISIL from Syria and the forging of a strategic alliance with the main Sunni military groups .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At heart, these alliances represent the interests of the former members of the Baath party and of the principal Sunni tribal unions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their attitude towards the Shia is strongly negative and clearly discernible in a number of claims with a conspiratorial bias .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Propaganda describes the Shia in a discriminatory manner , dating back to the medieval period of confrontation between the two communities .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These include terms such as shu'ubiyya and safawiya *. The same derogatory terms are also typical for ISIL propaganda .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Without equating ISIL and Iraqi opposition , they are apparently , albeit temporarily , aligned in the pursuit of a common goal  - bringing about the demise of the government in Baghdad , which is regarded as a direct proponent of the interests of Iran and its ambition to dominate the Sunnis in the Middle East .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This alliance, coupled with the markedly fragmented Iraqi political elite, has placed the country at a crossroads .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The extremist Islamism, compounded by the opportunism of the former political and military elite, has failed to be countered by an ideology based on a new national compromise .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Or , as a senior-ranking international representative has declared , it is imperative that Iraqi citizens consider whether they can still live within the borders of a single state .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Kim's decision to arrest and execute Chang Song-taek, his aunt's husband , long the ""grey eminence"" of Pyongyang politics, was a dramatic signal to the elite .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sorry fate of Chang was meant to show that nobody is immune from the wrath of the supreme leader .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These purges were obviously necessary to start changing the country , since Kim's policies will be very different from those of his father and grandfather .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So far, the most important changes can be seen in the field of economic management .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From late 2012, the North Korean government began to implement reforms which are remarkably similar to what China did in the early days of Deng Xiaoping, around 1980 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All praise belongs to God .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  what was the nature of that ""spiritual awakening""? The conventional view is that by 1964, Coltrane had moved away from his Methodist upbringing , adopting a ""pan-religious"" outlook with a particular interest in Eastern mysticism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In spite of that , ""A Love Supreme"" is still described as laden with Biblical symbolism: the title ""Psalm"" , and the rising cadences, reminiscent of black preachers' style, are offered as evidence that Coltrane was still rooted in Christianity .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This phrase has the semantics of the al-Fatiha , which is the first chapter or sura of the Holy Quran .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Arabic transliteration is 'al-Humdulilah ...' Since all faithful Muslims say the al-Fatiha five times a day or more , it is reasonable to assume that John heard this phrase from [his Muslim wife] Sister Naima many times.""  Lateef is referring to the poem Coltrane wrote and included in the liner notes of the album .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Coltrane wrote : ""No matter what ... It is with God . He is gracious and merciful"" and ends with ""All praise to God...""  What Lateef and others have noted is that ""gracious and merciful"" is a translation of ""rahman raheem"", the opening lines of the Fatiha .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gillespie was , as he would say , ""intrigued"" by ""the beautiful sound of the word Quran and discussed Islam extensively with Lateef .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But in 1948, in a shoot for a feature story with Life magazine, Gillespie was asked to pose shirtless, cross-legged, and bowing with his arms outstretched .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In the meetings the former al-Qaeda leader discussed supporting the FSA with money, weapons, and fighters , at a time when the CIA was a major conduit for the transfer of weapons from Libya to Syria .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While Belhaj was just one of many al-Qaeda affiliates involved in violent anti-government campaigns in both Libya and Syria , his openly acknowledged role underscores how the supposedly ""moderate"" FSA was, from early on in the Syrian civil war , as Iran repeatedly warned, deeply associated with and infiltrated by extremists .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over time, the problem grew so large with ISIL's rise that it became impossible to hide the monster that the US and its allies had created .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And so, Washington launched yet another chapter in its never-ending post-9/11 ""war on terror"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Notwithstanding Washington's professed determination to degrade and, ultimately, to destroy ISIL , Iran remains profoundly skeptical of US intentions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even after dramatic gains by ISIL in Iraq and the formation of a US-led coalition of the guilty to fight it , this coalition has, on average, carried out just nine airstrikes per day in both Iraq and Syria .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In comparison, western reports indicate that , in the same period, the Syrian air force alone has at times carried out up to 200 strikes in 36 hours .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even as these largely inconsequential US-led airstrikes are carried out in Iraq and Syria , some regional players continue to provide extensive logistical support to ISIL ; along Syria's borders with Jordan and the Israeli regime, the Nusra Front continues to collaborate with other extremist militias backed by foreign (including western) powers .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In light of these realities, Iranians  - who have been indispensable in preventing the fall of Damascus, Baghdad, Aleppo, and Erbil - simply do not buy the argument that a repentant US is now waging a real war against ISIL, the Nusra Front, and other extremist organisations in Iraq and Syria .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rather ,  Iranians see the evidence as pointing to a complex (yet foolish) policy undertaken by Washington and its allies for the purpose of ""containing"" the Islamic Republic .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What , then ,  would be the justification - under such circumstances and as Iranian allies are successfully pushing back extremists in Iraq and Syria - for the Islamic Republic to cooperate with the US in Iraq?

"In the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo murders, Ahmed Merabet's brother Malek correctly declared : ""My brother was Muslim and he was killed by two terrorists, by two false Muslims ... Islam is a religion of peace and love .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As far as my brother's death is concerned it was a waste .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He was very proud of the name Ahmed Merabet, proud to represent the police and of defending the values of the republic - liberty, equality, fraternity.""  As the new edition of Charlie Hebdo hits the stands with another cartoon cover depicting a weeping Prophet Muhammad under the heading ""All is forgiven"" , a critical question must be asked .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whom are we poking fun at? The terrorists or Muslims in general?  How can we use the prophet as the signpost to make fun of the terrorists while Lassana Bathily, a young Muslim immigrant from Mali, saved a whole group in the kosher supermarket and provided police with the key to ending the hostage crisis at the store .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Could it be that his inspiration and values are informed by the example of the prophet ; did we ask how he feels about the new cartoon and do we care to listen to the answer?  Who is being forgiven - the prophet, the terrorists or Muslims who believe in Islam and rightly hold the prophet in high esteem? By framing the response with the prophet cartoon , Charlie Hebdo is echoing CEO Rupert Murdoch's tweet that all Muslims ""must be held responsible"" for the Paris attack .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Francois Hollande in a ceremony honouring the three fallen police officers appropriately expressed the sentiments of many stating , ""France is at war against terrorism, jihadism, radicalism . France is not at war against Islam and Muslims"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  Charlie Hebdo's new cover will complicate matters further and in a short period will sideline many Muslims at a critical time in this global struggle against terrorism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlie Hebdo and the press have the right to publish what they like but Muslims are free to be offended by what is published and it is their right to be critical of such depictions .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No one should tell Muslims what they should or shouldn't get offended by as it is up to them to determine it for their community .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By depicting the prophet in a cartoon drawing , Charlie Hebdo chose racism and Islamophobic discourse against all Muslims .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This action transformed the discussion from one focused on terrorism, jihadism and murder into a narrow theological and legal debate concerning what can and can't be represented in images about the prophet .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is an issue involving all Muslims not only the terrorists .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another wasted opportunity to build on unity and bring Muslims into the global fold but Charlie Hebdo's editors chose to stay in the mud of racism and Islamophobia .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some argued that they had no choice and they needed to stay true to who they are by printing such a cartoon ; however this would be even more the case that the terrorist forced the subject of the cover rather than the other way around .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom of the press proponents will celebrate the release of the new cover and view it as a triumph over terrorism by insulting all Muslims through another racist cartoon depicting the prophet , as a hooked-nose Arab looking man .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let's be clear that the overwhelming majority of Muslims will continue to uphold their tradition that it is impermissible to represent the prophet's likeness in the form of an image , while certainly few had the opinion in the past that it is not prohibited .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This will not change anytime soon and it is none of anyone's business other than Muslims to decide on this matter .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Charlie Hebdo's cartoon attempted to bring the prophet into the debate around terrorism and Muslim violence , which in my view is a shortsighted strategy to deal with a most serious problem .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By selecting the prophet as the site of contestation , Charlie Hebdo took a page from the clash of civilisation advocates and built a cartoon narrative around it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In doing so they joined the coalition with the global Islamophobic industry and neo-conservative network that have been pushing this framing for almost 30 years and for sure since the collapse of the Soviet Union .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are in agreement that the terrorists claimed to act on behalf of Islam and as Malek Merabet stated his brother likewise is a Muslim and defended the newspaper from an ethical and moral ground that I fully believe are informed and grounded in Islam .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In deciding to print the new cover poking fun of the prophet's image , Charlie Hebdo sided with the terrorist framing of Islam and not with the Muslim police officer who lost his life defending them and would have been likewise offended by the new publication .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do believe that if Ahmad Merabet were alive today he would still show up at the newspaper to protect the individuals and their freedom to insult his faith while deeply aggrieved by it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this context, every time that we make the connections between terrorism and Islam we are only validating the terrorist's own epistemic and pushing the 99.99 percent of the Muslims away by insisting to insult the prophet and through it their faith .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One can have the freedom to say and do something while understanding the pain that it causes others if it is actually carried out .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today would have been a great day to have a cartoon of Ahmed smiling at the terrorist while defending the newspaper and the cartoonists in the name of his Islam .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not giving into the terrorist but standing with Muslims in opposing terrorism and by affirming the pain and suffering they experienced as a result of the heinous crime committed in their name .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet on a deeper level, the terrorist purporting to speak for Islam is a crime in itself , which for many Muslims would be akin to accepting the KKK claims to be the authentic voice of Christianity .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By framing the response to the terrorist through an explicit link to Islam , we are granting them the credentials they want and directing more attention to their cause .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The proper response should have been to remove their Islamic claims and celebrate and embrace the real Muslim heroes who defended and protected lives at both the Charlie Hebdo offices and the shoppers at the kosher supermarket .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who are we poking fun at? The Muslims as diverse minorities in France living at the margins of society are the object of the satire ; not the powerful or the terrorists .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is not the powerful but the powerless that is the object of the laughter .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Freedom of speech is not absolute and responsibilities are attached to it and more so when those living at the margins are subject to racism and discrimination .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We should defend free speech but doing so while listening to the voice of the voiceless living in our midst and dying for ""our"" collective right to insult their faith .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The news of the Guantanamo detainees' arrival to Uruguay received impressive coverage in international media .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Uruguay is the second Latin American country to accept Guantanamo detainees ; the first one was El Salvador , which welcomed two Chinese nationals in 2012 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The fact that there have been only two countries in Latin America accepting Guantanamo inmates is already particularly extraordinary, given US historical ascendancy on the region .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even US' main allies in the region, Chile and Colombia, rejected US proposals to accept prisoners from Guantanamo , considering the move highly unpopular .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps the spotlight fell on Uruguay as a Guantanamo detainee host because of Mujica's own media popularity over his unusually humble way of life as a world leader, and his progressive public speeches and political agenda .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He also managed to get a lot of media attention over the arrival of around forty Syrian refugees in October , although they were few in number compared to the thousands of refugees that neighbouring countries such as Brazil and Argentina have been accepting .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The day the detainees landed in Montevideo , Mujica sent an open letter to Uruguayans and Barack Obama .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The first sentence reads , ""Solidarity is the tenderness of the people"" , a quote from Pablo Neruda referring to the 1939 exodus of Spanish Republicans escaping fascism to South America .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Neruda's words well reflect the main humanitarian goal of the operation , which aims to to reinforce the image of Uruguay as a peacemaker and international reference for humanitarian issues .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Pepe"" has the aspiration, before ceding power to Tabare Vazquez at the beginning of 2015 , to spread his humanitarian legacy and reinforce his world reputation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Through the well-publicised gesture, Mujica aims to give hope to all those disenchanted people who still think that idealism and ethics in politics are still possible .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From a political perspective, Mujica's usual anti-imperialist stance left many in Uruguay astonished that he was willing to do a ""favour"" to Obama and accept the Guantanamo detainees .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is only in the second part of his open letter that his political goals become apparent .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mujica asks, as a gesture of reconciliation for all the American people, for the release of a 70 years-old Puerto Rican independence fighter, along with three Cuban detainees who are part of the group known as the Cuban Five , and whose controversial detention in the late 1990s led to a worldwide campaign for their release .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He also asks for the lifting of the ""unjust embargo"" imposed on ""our sister"" Cuba .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mujica's plea is reflective of an emerging regional bloc different than the usual ""left-leaning"" one .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is instead a heterogeneous regional political bloc able to come to terms with ideological differences and to find common ground for regional coexistence in the name of progress .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Best example of this is the ongoing peace talks between FARC and the Colombian government in Cuba, with the participation of Chile and Venezuela .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mujica's move, therefore, is not unprecedented .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Back in 2009 the late Hugo Chavez hinted at the possibility of accepting Guantanamo detainees in Venezuela and at raising the issue of Cuba's isoluation .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cuba's reintegration into regional life, after decades of US ostracism, represents the main political goal of the bloc and of Mujica humanitarian operation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore ,  it is not surprise that Jose Miguel Insulza, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) publicly lauded Mujica's move .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although leftist American governments have been particularly at odds with the Washington-based regional organisation, as consequence of the informal exclusion of Cuba under US pressure , Insulza has been working hard to reverse it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just recently, he said that he hoped both Cuba and the US would attend the next OAS summit planned for April in Panama City .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US is unlikely to release the Cuban political prisoners , but Cuba's unilateral release of Alan Gross after 5 years could be part of a larger swap following Mujica's move .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The six Guantanamo detainees will probably be the last ones to be resettled in the region .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Twenty five years ago on December 20, 1989, El Chorrillo, an Afro-Panamanian neighbourhood in the centre of Panama city was the scene of a criminal assault by the military forces of the United States government .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A vigorous assault from the most powerful military body on the planet was unleashed by President George H W Bush to execute an arrest warrant issued by a US court on General Manuel Antonio Noriega, the de facto head of the sovereign state of Panama, and up until that time an obedient servant of US interests in the region .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Significant elements of the outgunned Panamanian defence forces had barracks in the El Chorrillo community and as a consequence it was turned into a free fire zone by the invading forces, despite the fact that the invaders knew that thousands of civilians also lived in the densely populated community .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Marta Sanchez and others who experienced the assault remembered , the people of El Chorrillo , whose descendants came from the Caribbean to Panama as cheap labour to build the canal , never knew what hit them when they awoke to the sounds of machine gun fire from the 82nd Airborne division .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When the firing stopped and the smoke from the fires finally subsided , thousands were dead and the neighbourhood largely destroyed .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Black Lives Matter"" is a refrain whose importance is reflective of the value that black people place on our lives , yet we must disabuse ourselves of the illusion that black lives or any other lives matter when they stand in the way of the political and capital interests of US elites and that it is not limited to black communities in the US .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As human rights strategist Ajamu Baraka points out : ""The black lives taken by the murderous assault on Panama 25 years ago should be a sober reminder that US state violence is not confined to ghettoes and barrios of the US but is a central component of the racist, colonial, capitalist project that is the US . We cannot pretend that police brutality in the US and the devaluation of black life that it represents is restricted just to the black experience in the heart of the US empire.""  The attack on Panama and the massive loss of life and destruction was a harbinger of the lawlessness and aggression that would characterise US policies in the unipolar world of the late 20th and early 21st century .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When President Noriega failed to support US efforts to destabilise Nicaragua and had the audacity to publicly defy the US state with his defiant rhetoric , Bush had a perfect opportunity to establish the terms for what he referred to as a new world order of unchecked US power .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Panama became a demonstration project to communicate to the nations of the global south that resistance to US hegemony would be met with ferocious violence .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fact that scores of black lives would be lost as part of the demonstration was of no consequence to the policymakers of hegemony .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The structures and relations of repression are linked from the centre of the empire to its periphery states .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US police forces train police departments throughout the world through programmes such as the International Taskforce Agent Training, (conducted by US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations) including police officers that work in communities like El Chorrillo .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US police forces bring with them their military, interrogation, intimidation and racially biased tactics which involve use of excessive force on civilians .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is also internationally known that police are quicker to use force, shoot and kill black people, the same way that the US is quick to invade smaller countries with less power , because in the scope of the political reality, they matter less .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Violence is integral to the project of western colonial capitalist domination from Palestine to Ferguson .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""On this 25th anniversary of the US invasion of Panama, we need to remember that the struggle for black liberation is ongoing . US authorities must be made to understand that the value of black life is not determined by the borders that those black bodies find themselves . The destruction in Panama is a reminder to my generation that our demand is not new,"" says Alicia Garza, National Domestic Workers Special Projects director and cofounder of #BlackLivesMatter .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While we remember the victims of the US invasion of Panama , the families of the thousands of victims of US criminality in Panama are still demanding justice and accountability 25 years later .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like the families of Eric Garner and Mike Brown and the victims of police violence in the US, they are part of the long line of victims of US criminality globally .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These crimes will continue until the people - black people in particular - are able to build the power necessary to ensure that black lives really matter in the US and across the globe .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The announcement of a new era of relations between the United States and Cuba came as a surprise to many who follow and study the relationship between the two rivals .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The old guard of Cuban exiles, led by Senator Marco Rubio, predictably reacted with their usual anger .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By contrast, many second generation Cuban Americans and advocates reacted differently - with optimism and hope for change .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is important to understand those reactions to the recent announcement as part of a broader evolution towards new relations between the US and Cuba over 20 years in the making, following fundamental security, economic, and political changes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The end of the Cold War in 1989 spelled change for Latin America , just as it did for the world .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Cuba, it meant the loss of its biggest sponsor , which plunged the island into a five-year economic tailspin, contracted its GDP by 30 to 45 percent, and precipitated a number of changes to Cuban policy and law .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Those reforms have accelerated throughout the last decade, including an ongoing plan to unify the island's dual currency .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cuba has had no choice but to liberalise portions of its economy and European countries have been able to take advantage of those opportunities .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the last two decades, a Cuban economy starved for growth has looked overseas and seen the island more willing to come to agreement regarding foreign presence .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The implications of the fall of the Soviet Union were not only economic in nature, but also resulted in a shift in US policy towards Latin America more broadly .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the 20-plus years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the US has tolerated, or even openly collaborated with , leftist regimes in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Honduras that in another era would have been deliberately undermined, or perhaps overthrown, as in the cases of Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The strategic and military calculus of our relationship with Cuba has fundamentally changed .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Presidents and Congress no longer have the blanket justification of Cuba as a military threat as they did during the Cold War .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Cuban exiles, 1989 was not so much a watershed moment as an opportunity to continue applying pressure to a failing regime .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Cuban-American lobby continued to promote isolationism , believing that this post-Soviet moment was finally the chance to see a democratic counterrevolution on the island .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This belief that isolation would force the collapse of Castro regime restricted policy responses available to the US government and presidential administrations .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Changes in the global economic and political relationship with Cuba did not affect US policy and Cuba, for the most part, was excluded from the more moderate and tolerant US foreign policy towards Latin America .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Republican presidents and legislators proved to be more punitive towards the island - particularly given their reliance on the Cuban-American lobby for monetary and electoral support in south Florida .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite a cooling in relations during the late 1990s, due to the shooting down of the two US planes flown by ""Brothers to the Rescue"", President Bill Clinton eased restrictions on humanitarian aid, broadened the ability to send remittances , increased allowable person-to-person interactions, and resumed direct flights between the countries .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Clinton's actions were part of a broader government strategy of ""constructive engagement"" , in which the US would actively engage with the Cuban people, but maintain pressure on the government .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The new millennium did not bring significant changes in relations as, true to Republican form , President George W Bush maintained the status quo of ""constructive engagement"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If anything , his administration took a harder line, at times including Cuba in the same paragraph as the ""Axis of Evil"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However , even as President Bush, Senator Marco Rubio, and conservative Cuban- American legislators continued to push a hard line on Cuba , the profile of the average Cuban American changed .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The stereotypical conservative Cuban - still upset, and rightfully so, over the nationalisation of private property and human rights abuses during the revolution - still attempts to dominate political discourse .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But a new face of the Cuban American has emerged - young, second-generation children have come of age with the desire to see for themselves the homeland that they have only heard about in stories ; and new, post-1989 migrants , who are economic rather than political refugees , have closer personal ties to the island .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The election of President Obama and the nomination of Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State signalled a new era with a renewed focus on diplomacy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Four months after taking office , the administration quietly continued to liberalise relations between the US and Cuba .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  Alan Gross' imprisonment in 2009 gave opportunity for the age-old arguments against Cuba to resurface , with the old guard claiming that nothing had changed and seeing it as the latest example of the long history of Cuban aggression .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I do not dispute the fact that the Castro brothers have been harsh dictators and that their system of government has deeply damaged multiple generations of Cubans, nor do I dispute that regime change should still be a goal of US policy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However as my analysis has shown , the rest of the story has changed .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cuba's economy continues to search for growth , and the government is actively looking outside the country for investment .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Long gone are the existential security threats that came from the island during the Cold War .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moreover ,  this reflects the changing opinions of Cuban Americans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The new modes of engagement announced by Obama on December 17 were not an acknowledgement of defeat , but an effort for a new way forward that reflects those changes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"December 17 will no doubt be an important moment in the lives of Cubans and Cuban Americans , but it deserves more analysis than the knee-jerk reactions on the front pages of newspapers and talk shows in the US .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obama should be commended for basing policy on facts rather than emotions .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Yet ,  of the total of 779 men and boys that have been detained at Guantanamo Bay since 2002 , only nine have been convicted of any crime .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of the 127 remaining detainees, 59 have been unanimously cleared by US intelligence and security agencies, of any involvement in terrorism but continue to await their release .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The remaining 68 inmates are classified as ""indefinite detainees"", a Kafka-esque category used for detainees ineligible for either trial or release .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These men will face Periodic Review Board hearings, an incipient interagency process that will assess whether an inmate poses a threat to the US or is eligible for transfer .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  this procedure lacks guarantees to due process and will likely prolong situations of arbitrary detention .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moreover , as inmate transfers continue , the US must abide by the principle of ""non-refoulement"" , ensuring detainees' right to not be returned to a place where they will face persecution, torture or death .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ameziane's forcible repatriation is only one of several other cases .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"However ,  the question over how material and intellectual authors of torture will be held accountable in accordance with international law remains .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Additionally ,  under the Common Article Three of the Geneva Convention - the article which bars torture, cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment against prisoners of war - the US could be held accountable for war crimes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally , under international law, amnesty laws are not permitted and the authors of torture must be prosecuted - at home or abroad .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The public availability of documentation to establish the truth behind Guantanamo Bay will no doubt play a pivotal role in dismantling the architecture of state-sanctioned human rights abuses .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While the US Senate's scathing report revealed some of the most shocking instances of torture , its 6,700 pages are the tip of the iceberg .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Is it mere coincidence, then , that Abbas has been lacklustre in campaigning for Barghouti's release from Israeli jail; or in pursuing and implementing national unity deals with Hamas that call for elections?  Since the signing of the latest reconciliation agreement in April, Abbas has at various times threatened to end it , and has been openly adversarial towards Hamas .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PA  - which is meant to safeguard Palestinian rights - serially abuses them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"As such, the PA is not only failing to curb Israeli abuses , but is busy perpetrating its own, all under Abbas' watch .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The PA has garnered a reputation among Palestinians for managing the occupation rather than striving to end it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One way it does this is ""security coordination"" with Israel , which Abbas described last year as ""sacred"" despite the vast majority of Palestinians opposing it .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Such coordination serves Israel by enabling it to subcontract its occupation , and serves the PA by helping it suppress internal dissent .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It certainly does not benefit the Palestinian people .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abbas and his foreign minister have made grotesque assurances that as long as he is president , he will not allow an uprising against Israel .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the PA , which is supposed to be part of a national liberation struggle , is willing to put down an uprising by its own people against their subjugation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is nothing short of betrayal .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For more than 20 years, the PA has participated in a ""peace process"" that has greatly entrenched Israeli control .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abbas himself was an architect of the disastrous Oslo Accords .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The occupied territories are now so colonised and fragmented that a viable Palestinian state is widely considered impossible .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  Abbas still wants to negotiate , despite Israel being clearly opposed to Palestinian self-determination .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What , then ,  is the point of negotiating? Perhaps to preserve the privileged elites to which the PA and the ""peace process"" gave birth .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After all ,  allegations of corruption and nepotism, including Abbas and his family, are nothing new .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the help of international aid, the PA is the largest employer of Palestinians, much like other autocracies that encourage public dependence on the state to avoid mass unrest .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A power imbalance alone cannot explain Abbas' policy choices regarding Israel .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He opposes armed resistance, and has gone to great lengths to disarm militants in the West Bank .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  he also opposes peaceful forms of resistance, including the increasingly effective Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore ,  it took the PA more than two years since Palestine's upgraded UN status to apply to join the International Criminal Court , despite repeated threats to do so amid constant Israeli provocations .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That Abbas finally relented may not only, or necessarily, be about losing patience with Israel , but about assuaging mounting Palestinian anger at his procrastination in applying to the ICC .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile ,  he says he will keep pushing for a UN Security Council resolution calling for a deadline to end Israel's occupation , despite the certainty of repeated failure by US veto .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abbas seems to be attempting a balancing act .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He wants to prove to Israel, and his western and Arab backers , that he is their best Palestinian partner , safe in the knowledge that they will not accept Hamas rule , but mindful not to suffer the same fate as Yasser Arafat once he was no longer deemed useful or reliable .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  his recent, uncharacteristic defiance against Israel reflects a need to stop his flagging domestic popularity turning into an uprising against him and the PA .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"His website , which was shut down during the final hours of the siege , had a message dated December 14 , which described why Muslims ""fight against the oppression and terrorism"" of the US and its allies , including the UK and Australia .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The rampant speculation before this was unnecessary and unhelpful, however , and letting the siege sow fear, enough so to publicly describe it as ""terrifying"" , was handing a victory to an extremist .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the hot Australian summer setting in , many people's minds turn to beer, barbeques, family, and Christmas presents , not the possibility of ""politically motivated violence"", as Abbott wisely phrased it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Greece is heading towards snap elections on January 25 after the conservative coalition government, currently in office, failed to reach a supermajority of 180 MPs in order to elect the new president of the republic as dictated by the Greek constitution .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stavros Demas, a former European Commissioner and candidate of choice of the two ruling parties, was never really proposed with the purpose to achieve and express the maximum consensus among the Greek population .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Demas is coming from the heart of the ruling conservative New Democracy party and symbolises the party's loyalty to the current establishment in the EU .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The main opposition party, SYRIZA, openly invested in the constitutional opportunity to overturn the government months ago claiming that its endurance in office for two more years would be abnormal as it would contradict the popular sentiment tracked in every opinion poll during the past year or so .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By all odds , SYRIZA is leading the polls by 3 percent to 10 percent and is expected to form a government either based on a robust majority of the left in parliament, or, in coalition with minor parties who are willing to follow its agenda , renegotiate a bailout agreement that will not be catastrophic for Greek society and the Greek economy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the fact that both the German and the Greek conservative governments present the current bailout programme as a ""success story"" , most analysts around the globe agree that it has actually failed .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Six years of continuing recession have resulted in a loss of 25 percent of GDP and a rise of unemployment to 27 percent .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Greek debt is well over 170 percent of GDP now and according to Troika estimations it will be no less than 120 percent by 2020 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These facts translate to two things .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly , there can be no development under austerity policies for the majority of the population , even if the Eurozone fixes its competitiveness problem and exits deflation and the Greek economy starts developing at a growth rate of over 4 percent  - which is highly unlikely .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondly, there can be no functioning democracy so long as Greece is not given choices other than poverty, degrowth and exclusion .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Greece is in the state of protectorate at the moment, bound in a bailout agreement that strips its ability to produce and reject different solutions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it's not just Greece .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spain follows the same path both in regards to the social crisis and the political management of that crisis .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poverty and unemployment figures look much like the Greek ones and the Spanish conservative government resorts to authoritarian measures in order to keep the Spanish society tight .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example ,  the public security law voted a few days ago is a clear attempt of the government to muzzle protests over its handling of the financial crisis .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deflation hits Europe and the prospects of its biggest economies like France's, Italy's and Germany's, are not looking good to pull the Eurozone back to the track of growth .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result, political forces that question austerity are gaining momentum whether they are nationalist Euroskeptic and even fascist, or progressive, democratic and pro-European like the Spanish ally party of SYRIZA, Podemos .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is striking about SYRIZA is that its critique and analysis since 2009 have been proven to be correct despite the continuing fear campaign against him both inside and out of the country .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recently Prime Minister Antonis Samaras accused the party of the radical left that it will lead Greece to default and bankruptcy if it tries to negotiate lighter terms for the repayment of the Greek debt .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bloomberg argues that the end of austerity may boost the global economy and even Morgan Stanley asks bond holders not to be afraid of the coming elections .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the fear-mongering campaign, economic analysts reject now a possible ""grexit"" due to markets' belief that some kind of deal is preferable both for Greece and the EU .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this environment, a SYRIZA victory would mean two very important things; the return of the power to decide to a democratically elected government and the restoration of inclusiveness and national sovereignty and the opening of a new chapter in European politics , where the parties and the organisations who challenge austerity will have the momentum .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Greek people have patiently given the opportunity to the neoliberal technocrats of the IMF and the EU along with their local counterparts in the conservative coalition government to experiment and find a way out of the mess for more than five years only to receive back pain and failure .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now they're being given the opportunity to exercise their democratic right to choose which way the country will turn .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SYRIZA is asking for debt forgiveness and a New Deal for Europe, both rather moderate demands coming from a radical left party .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If SYRIZA actually wins the elections , the Greek people will be the first to send a clear message against austerity, one that can spark change, much needed on the continent right now .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This Samiti, a not-so-small wing of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a militant Hindu organisation, contended that far from propagating religious intolerance , it was only righting historical wrongs and injustice perpetrated by Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics who , in order to bolster the numbers of their respective faiths , had lured and coerced Hindus to stray from their original religion .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It would be downright specious, even dishonest , to claim that missionaries and proselytisers' activities in India had nothing but a salubrious effect .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Historical records bear ample testimony to the rigorous implementation of St Caprion's axiom - ""extra ecclessium nulla salus"" (outside the Church, no salvation), even by the proverbial fire and sword, especially by explorer-cum - conquistadors like Vasco da Gama, the tales of whose brutalities in enforcing a harvest of faith in the erstwhile Portuguese-controlled state of Goa are legion .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Active proselytisation was an integral part of the colonial project ; indeed , as historian Ranajit Guha states , ""the Bible and the toothbrush were one of the main instruments of the British colonialists"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This reveals that the missionaries did bring ""material"" gifts to the native population - especially western medicine and hygiene .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But these benefits aside , there was another more substantive reason why many Indians, especially the Dalits (Untouchables) and tribals embraced Christianity, and even Islam .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Both these religions liberate them, or at least hold out the promise of unshackling them from the pernicious burden of the caste-system which is so deeply entrenched in Hinduism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Though ostensibly secular in objective , the anti-conversion laws in force in various states of India - Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh (all areas with a significantly high population of tribals, Dalits, the depressed castes, and reeling from poverty, illiteracy and abysmal healthcare) in effect gives the government a vast swathe of control over people's choices in matters of faith and religion .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Going way beyond , they endow the government with surveillance powers over a constituency of people .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Starting from the premise that the freedom of religion and religious chose of ""those who are converted"" (note ; the laws never say ""those who convert"") need to be protected from incursions of proselytisers - the various anti-conversion legislations, ironically termed as ""freedom of religion"" laws - make it mandatory for the convertees to inform the head of the district administration .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They will then give the go-ahead only once he is satisfied that one is not swapping religions for monetary benefits or other inducements, or by being taken in by fraud, or being swayed by either promises of salvation or threats of incurring divine displeasure , as the case may be .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The laws of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh make it incumbent upon neighbours or villagers to inform the administration and the police of any activities of pastors, nuns and clergymen which could give rise to a suspicion of proselytising motives .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Anyone found guilty is visited with imprisonment extending to three years, and with a financial penalty of 50,000 rupees (approximately $800) .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tellingly, the punishment is doubled if those who convert are women, or members of the lower castes and tribal communities .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These laws are invoked and enforced only when a group of people, not individuals, seek to move out of Hinduism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One might well question - in face of such provisions , do the laws even need to use the modifiers ""forcible"" or ""fraudulent""?  Also ,  not a single legislation even addresses , let alone punish, ""reconversion"" which the many Hindu zealots are painstakingly claiming as totally voluntary and a righteous reply to the violation of rights by colonisers and their ilk .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indians look up to the judiciary to uphold the secular values of the republic , and the Supreme Court has, time and again, thwarted onslaughts on people's core fundamental right of religious freedom .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Current Iranian discourse - political and cultural - revolves around advancing the view of superiority of the Iranian race, Shia Islam, and Iranian culture .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Such discourse focuses on the uniqueness of the Iranian race as one that is steeped in civilisation, juxtaposed with the Arabs who represent , according to this view, the ""other"", i.e  less civilised .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In realpolitik terms, amid the instability and chaos plaguing Arab states, Iran presents itself as the alternative power to fill the vacuum in the region .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From the Iranian perspective , the US has failed to solve many of the international crises and in some cases, it has created them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Iran, in this respect, is positioning itself as a rising power that will replace the US as the dominant power in the region .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Echoing such discourse , Kazem Sajjadpour, an advisor on Strategic Affairs to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran said, in Persian, during his participation in the roundtable discussion on the website Shia News Association , that while the Arab world suffers from fragmentation and strategic paralysis  - while under the influence of western powers - Iran enjoys territorial integrity and cohesiveness, and is endowed with strategic resources .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of these are factors that could make Iran the new rising power in the region .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  Iran is making the case that the entire Arab world revolves around it - and cannot survive without it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Following the reports of Iranian aircraft attacking ISIL targets last week, Iranian and US officials issued statements to emphasise that they are not coordinating their air strikes .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite these denials, there is an ironic element to this strike that both sides cannot deny .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Islamic Republic of Iran used US-produced, Vietnam-era F-4 Phantom aircraft against a common foe, ISIL .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Contextualising these Iranian air strikes within the greater history of how these planes ended up in the Iranian air force in the first place demonstrates a geostrategic reality for US foreign policy : Iran's geographical depth means the US has needed Iran during both the Cold War and post-Cold War era, regardless of the government in Tehran .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Islamic Republic's fleet of F-4s and F-14s were inherited from the Royal Iranian Air Force of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Iran under the shah was one of the few US allies that could purchase the advanced F-14 Tomcat interceptor of ""Top Gun"" fame, with one of the most sophisticated radars at the time .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The shah's shopping list of US-supplied aircraft boosted the economy of the US defence industry, as well as served US geopolitical interests during the Cold War .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran's advanced military allowed it to emerge as a regional hegemon .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since it shared a long border with the Soviet Union , the shah's armed forces served as a bulwark against Communist penetration in the Middle East and the oil-rich Gulf region, and a deterrent against an anti-western Baathist Iraq .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran's geostrategic location has not diminished as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No US or NATO ally, including Israel, Turkey or Saudi Arabia can cover Iran's geographical depth .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Iran's location means it can influence events from Iraq to the Gulf, from the Caucasus and adjoining Caspian and Black Seas to Central Asia, and from Afghanistan to South Asia .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Video footage .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The video footage released by Al Jazeera of Iranian F-4s attacking ISIL forces in Iraq's Diyala province is reminiscent of another attack when two of the same US-supplied Iranian aircraft bombed Iraq's nuclear facility in Tuwaitha in 1980, during the first year of the Iran-Iraq War .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this first air strike, the US and the Islamic Republic shared the same interests, albeit for different purposes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Islamic Republic feared Iraq could develop a nuclear option as it fought a two-front war for its survival, including a domestic Iranian Kurdish uprising , and a potential pro-shah counterrevolution launched from within the Iranian air force - the same unit that was needed to target Iraq .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US, despite its tensions with Iran during the hostage crisis, did not want to see Iraq develop a nuclear capability that could threaten its ally Israel during the 1980s .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Israel successfully followed up the attack against Iraq's nuclear facility in 1981 , and the US-led air strikes during the 1991 Gulf war were designed to destroy this nuclear infrastructure again , which had been rebuilt despite the Israeli air raid .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thus the air raid Iran conducted against ISIL was not the first time both Washington and the Islamic Republic might have both wished for a successful sortie of Iranian F-4 pilots .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite this common interest during the Iran-Iraq War, the US titled towards Iraq and directly engaged Iranian naval forces in the Gulf to protect Kuwaiti oil vessels , downing an Iranian civilian aircraft in the process .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran fought a proxy war against US forces in Iraq following the 2003 Iraq war by supporting Iraqi militias during the insurgency .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both the US and Iran will continue to clash over their respective relationships with Israel .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet despite these differences both the US and Iran cooperated with each other to remove the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001 .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The joint cause against the Taliban in 2001, or ISIL in 2014, demonstrates that despite the decades-long mistrust and proxy conflicts between the two sides, geographical realpolitik can force both states to engage in alliances of convenience .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In an AP interview, the new US ambassador in Baghdad, Stuart Jones said , ""Let's face it . Iran is an important neighbour to Iraq . There has to be cooperation between Iran and Iraq."" Such a statement is significant .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Iranian government has been trying to force the US to concede this geographic fact since 2003 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Indirect evidence .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This statement serves as indirect evidence that the US and Iran appear to have worked out a modus vivendi in dealing with ISIL in Iraq .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet when Al Jazeera released the video of the air strike , the Iranian government initially denied the report , only to confirm it days later , adding the caveat that it was launched at the behest of the central government in Iraq .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The initial denial raises the question as to whether Iran did not want to upset this alliance of convenience with US by launching its own air strikes .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this case ,  rather than upsetting the US , both the Iranian and Iraqi governments probably wanted to keep this air strike quiet for domestic Iraqi politics .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The close cooperation between the post-2003 Iraqi government and Iran has been criticised by critics within Iraq over the last decade as a surrender of Baghdad to ""Safavis"", a reference to the 16th century Shia dynasty in Iran that tried to secure what is today Iraq from the Ottomans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This footage, along with pictures of Qassim Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Quds Force , training Iraqi forces on Iranian equipment used by both the Iraqi military and Shia militias , have only alienated Iraq's disenfranchised communities with whom Baghdad needs to ultimately reconcile .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This modus vivendi over Iraq will hinge on the future of the ongoing nuclear negotiations and the Syrian civil war .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But in both cases, there could be an endgame that resolves the mutual antagonisms between Iran and the US .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Media coverage acknowledges that despite Iranian-US cooperation in Iraq, they still support rival sides in the Syrian civil war .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  even in that conflict, they do share a mutual desire for that conflict to end with a political solution .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Such a solution will save Iran from the huge financial costs of subsidising the Syrian military and end a conflict that the US has been hesitant to engage in since its onset in the summer of 2011 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Al Jazeera's correspondent in Iraq, Imran Khan, in an article in November raised the question : Are the US and Iran on the same side in Iraq? The answer to this question is not only a ""yes"" in Iraq, but could also be a ""yes"" in terms of the long-term stability of Syria and Afghanistan .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is domestic politics in both the US and Iran that prevent any official from saying this publicly .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stakes are high in the latest round of nuclear talks starting today in Geneva between Iran and the P5+1 at the deputy foreign minister level .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over the past week, US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Jawed Zarif have held long conversations in Geneva and Paris , lasting over seven hours .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both realise that more flexibility is required to avoid the break up of the talks .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"British Prime Minister David Cameron spoke on the subject with US President Barack Obama and the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the EU foreign policy chief all held talks separately with Zarif .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet if both sides continue to stick to their strict red lines it is questionable whether this round of talks will be any better than the last .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It may be time for more flexible red lines if failure is to be avoided .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Chances are less than 50/50,"" admits Obama, in a joint press conference with the British Prime Minister David Cameron when both leaders spent well over half of their press conferences spelling out what was at stake if a deal with Iran was not finalised by the June deadline .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Obama explained how ""the most successful, the most effective sanctions regime"" had eventually led Iran to the negotiating table .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He said : ""If we can get a verifiable deal with the necessary assurances then that would be the best deal.""  Yet Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson said sanctions are a ""worn out policy"" and asked the White House to adopt a ""logical approach"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran would not accept a deal that constrains its enrichment programme without the West reducing sanctions .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Now we have come to a stage in the talks that requires the other side to take its decision to enable us to move forward,"" said Zarif when arriving in Geneva .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""There needs to be some new and comprehensive proposals.""  The latest directive from Iran's leader , Ali Khamenei is that officials ""should take away the weapon of sanctions from the enemy"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Even one step in retreat will lead to enemy's advance,"" he said .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He is angered that ""Americans say flagrantly that even if Iran withdraws in the nuclear issue , the sanctions will not be lifted all together and at once"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Khamenei is referring to the main point of contention ; the issue of the period of curbing Iran's enrichment programme in exchange for the lifting of four sets of sanctions imposed on Iran by the UN, EU and the US .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US wants the curbing of sanctions to be in a period covering well over 10 years, closer to 20 or in ""double digits"" as US administration officials put it .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is to ensure Iran's breakout time is prolonged .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran sees this as an attempt for forcing it to forego what it calls its peaceful enrichment programme .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It does not accept this long period of curbing its enrichment programme without the reciprocal reduction in sanctions .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is believed that the Iranian leader could be persuaded with anything below 10 years or a timeframe in a ""single digit"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Iran is deeply suspicious of the US and the West,"" said Obama .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mutual distrust is at the core of the failure of the unwillingness on both side to be flexible .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Khamenei still refers to the US as ""enemy"" and the US continues to refuse to lift sanctions fearing Iran's return to enrichment .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is not clear if western trust has taken another blow from reports that Syria is still trying to make nuclear weapons and has been getting help from Iran and North Korea .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The two sides would not be able to reach an agreement especially when the US Congress is pushing daily for imposing further sanctions in support of the Israeli lobby .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Republican Senator Mark Kirk and Democratic Senator Robert Menendez are finalising a bill for tougher sanctions .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Senator Bob Corker is also working on a bill to ensure the congress must approve any final deal with Iran .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran hardliners answer sanctions with the threat of enrichment .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Further sanctions will result in a vote in the Iranian parliament for continuing enrichment,"" said Ali Larijani, the head of Judiciary .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The enemies wanted to deprive Iran from its right to the nuclear technology and even resorted to military threats to this end.""  Hardline members of parliament are proposing a bill to increase the uranium enrichment programme to 60 percent .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""I am not , repeat, not suggesting that we are in immediate war footing , should negotiations with Iran fail,"" said Obama .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At the same time he made it clear he would veto any congressional attempts at new sanctions against Iran .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Hold your fire,"" he told the congress .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""We must not jeopardise the chance"" to get a verifiable deal with Iran .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although Republicans now hold a 54-46 seat majority in the Senate , it is not clear whether there would manage to get the 67 votes required in the Senate to override an Obama veto of any Iran legislation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In intensive meetings with his European counterpart, Zarif has no doubt conveyed to them that if there is no easing of the sanctions there would be little he could do back home .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He has asked for ""serious and brave decisions"" in order to move forward .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The world has heard expressions of commitments and hope from Iran and the countries P5+1 for over a year now .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet those brave words must be coupled either with more flexibility as recommended by experts or coupled alternatively with new ideas, new methods and possibly new redlines .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is still time and several avenues are still open .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example there could be more direct involvement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, in the form of a representative, a high calibre UN negotiator , who could add momentum to the talks and create synergy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Otherwise it is difficult to see how the negotiators can come up with a solution if they have not managed it in the past 14 months .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The brutal and tragic murders of 12 people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris - 10 staff members and two police officers - by masked gunmen has triggered an outpouring of shock and grief, not only in France but around the world .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Large, spontaneous vigils filled the streets of many French cities , while social media was awash with solidarity and condemnation, including the hashtags #JeSuisCharlie and #NotInMyName , which was used by Muslims condemning the attacks .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Police in France have identified and released the photographs of two brothers suspected to be involved in the attack while early speculation focused on the premise that Muslim extremists were behind the dreadful act, especially given the magazine's long history of satirising Islam and other religions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The two brothers have been identified as 32-year-old Said Kouachi and 34-year-old Cherif Kouachi .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This theory has been reinforced by eyewitness accounts of the men shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The designer who was forced to let the assailants in says they told her they were with al-Qaeda , while , according to AFP, the police claim that one of the killers remarked : ""We have avenged the prophet.""  Why Prophet Muhammad would need anyone to ""avenge"" him is beyond me .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The prophet endured far more mockery, humiliation, insult and rejection during his lifetime without needing or ordering hitmen to defend his honour than that meted out by a group of equal-opportunity French cartoonists who despise and satirise all forms of organised religion .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even if ,  like with Anders Breivik in Norway , the perpetrators turn out not to be linked to Islamist groups , the collateral damage to French and European Muslims has already been done, despite one of the fallen police officers being a Muslim .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In neighbouring Germany , the thousands of Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA) who have turned out to rallies, though still small enough to be labelled a ""flop"" , has set alarm bells ringing to the extent that strong counter protests have taken place .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like Muslims who fantasise about an ahistorical caliphate, conservative Europeans who dream of a bygone utopia of a Europe uncontaminated by Islam or immigration , miss the reality that the ""Islamisation of the West"" occurred centuries ago .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Islamic civilisation is so hard-wired into Europe's cultural, social and intellectual DNA that it would be impossible to expunge its influence .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The same applies in the other direction, in light of Christendom's and the West's powerful influence on Arab and Islamic society .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"As someone who is well aware of the destructive influence of violent Islamism in the Middle East , I can, at a certain level, sympathise with fears in the West over radicalisation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But Islamic extremism is mostly a threat to Muslim societies, not to Europe , as a minority has never, in history, imposed its will on a majority, except in the form of a military conqueror .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This exaggerated sense of threat can be seen in the enormous hysteria in segments of the media and among some politicians regarding the small trickle of European jihadists who have gone to fight in Syria .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"While it is important to be vigilant and to find effective ways to deal with the threat posed by returning fighters , society must steer clear of stigmatising Europe's already marginalised and distrusted Muslim communities .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is because it is unfair to blame an entire group for the behaviour of a tiny minority and it is also counterproductive , as marginalisation is a significant, but not the only, factor in radicalisation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In middle school, we would have parent-teacher meetings at school ; my classmates had their parents next to them for the meeting , but I had no one next to me .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Although there is no evidence that Truman was suggesting CIA involvement in the assassination , it is impossible to believe that the late president's difficulties with the CIA were far from Truman's mind .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a former president who the Kennedy White House regularly briefed on foreign policy issues and decisions , Truman knew how the CIA essentially steamrolled Kennedy into the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba (and other anti- Castro actions) , leading Kennedy to tell a friend that he wanted ""to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kennedy never had the chance to follow up on that idea but it was essentially what Truman suggested a month after Kennedy's death .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Obviously, Truman's recommendation had no effect .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  the Washington establishment apparently took action to see that Truman's piece disappeared almost without a trace (easier in those pre-internet days) .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, the Washington Post only published the piece in its morning edition , pulling it from view after that (a peculiar way to treat an opinion piece by a former president, especially on such a weighty issue) .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"McGovern also reports that former CIA Director Allen Dulles , who Kennedy fired after the Bay of Pigs debacle , actually flew down to Truman's home in Independence, Missouri to get the former president to retract .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although Dulles reported back to his friends that Truman had indeed recanted , he clearly never did .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  six months after publishing the column in the Post , Truman wrote to the managing editor of Look Magazine that he intended the CIA as an intelligence gathering agency only and not a place where ""strange activities"" would be launched .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No doubt, the Bay of Pigs and Cuba, in general, were not the only examples of CIA interventions that disturbed Truman .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the years between the end of Truman's administration and his Washington Post column, the CIA had orchestrated the overthrow of governments in Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), Congo (1960), Dominican Republic (1961), South Vietnam (1963), Brazil (1964) .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Within a year following Truman's death, the CIA successfully brought down the Allende government in Chile (1973) .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As for its activities since, its intelligence activities have clearly continued to be a low priority (it has gotten Iraq wrong from the start, culminating most recently in its failure to predict the rise of ISIL) while , what Truman called its ""cloak and dagger"" operations , have proliferated .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to historian William Blum , writing in Foreign Policy Journal , in the last 69 years, the CIA has (often in conjunction with the military) ""(1) attempted to overthrow more than 50 governments , most of which were democratically-elected, (2) attempted to suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20 countries, (3) grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries, (4) dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries, (5) attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders.""  And now there are the horrific reports of torture and, equally appalling, the defense of CIA torture by former CIA driectors, other top CIA officials and, most enthusiastically, former Vice President Dick Cheney who famously told NBC five days after 9/11 that it was now time for US intelligence agencies to operate on the ""dark side"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is the context of the torture debate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Truman understood , the CIA was dangerous and should be broken up or, in Kennedy's words, ""splinter[ed] into a thousand pieces and scatter[ed] to the winds"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lebanon has just done the apparently unthinkable and placed visa control on the entry of Syrians into the country .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imagine 12 million French in the UK today .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Lebanese government has assured international agencies that it will still permit and facilitate humanitarian cases , but the step is a telling one .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Borders don't seem to mean much in this Middle East , if they ever did .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The refugees are the terrible consequence and victims of these conflicts that plague this area .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The best response to them is not visas but a proper joint response by the Lebanese government assisted by international insititutions .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The reality however is that the former is incapable , and the latter insufficiently funded to deal with such a massive influx .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result, many refugees are living in terrible conditions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The other harsh reality is that the Lebanese government has said that this will not affect Syrian ""visitors"" to Lebanon .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are six classes of visitors in the new system and the Syrian middle class and rich are unlikley to be affected .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Walid Jumblatt stated that his country should differentiate between ""refugees who are fleeing death and destruction in Syria after they lost their homes,"" and those who intend to be politically active , but the reality is that the poorest will be most affected .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  it's a large question mark whether Lebanon has the capacity to even implement the measure it has just taken .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Syrian presence in Lebanon is so pervasive it may well be impossible to manage the situation , except to manage some future inflow .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore ,  the idea of Lebanon, a country barely treading water, being able to manage such a problem is unrealistic .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Only a regional and international effort of significance can manage such a scale , and regional powers are busy carving their fiefdoms and creating the very problem rather than solving it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The plight of the refugees is key but it is also important to perceive this event from the perspective of the host country; a small nation with very poor governance and infrastructure in the midst of regional turmoil .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a way, this is Lebanon's very small response to the erosion of Sykes Picot .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Syrians are indeed everywhere in Lebanon .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Beirut, and in every village and town one visits .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flights from Beirut to Europe are one-third to half full of Syrians .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The relations in Lebanon between the two peoples, despite some racism and ugly incidents, could have been far worse .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Until now ,  Lebanese hosting of the refugees is characterised by neither generosity nor enmity, but by a passive acceptance of fate .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Minister of Health Abu Faour has been on an intense and mediatic campaign to clean up the food industry in Lebanon , cracking down restaurants, slaughterhouses, and airport storage sites .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite complaints , this clean up , if it lasts , is a welcome step for Lebanese ; it is national, potentially affects everyone positively, and is an act of government .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second ,  in an echo of the Nahr el-Bared campaign, the Lebanese army is taking responsibility in the Northern Bekaa and Hermel areas against the radical groups who are effectively fighting the Syrian war on Lebanese soil .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pride in the Lebanese army is rising .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are also rumours that the Lebanese government will also take on the murderous Indie-500 speeders on Lebanse highways in the spring .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If this does occur in addition to bold step of visas for Syrians , a move that would have been unheard of when Lebanon was effectively a vassal state of Damascus, then indeed Lebanon could see the bare beginnings of emerging out of chaos through these small attempts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The political realities in Lebanon are of course more complicated and illusory than this .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many only see in all of the above feeble attempts to deflect from the reality of a total political vaccuum .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed , the Lebanese visa step is obviously not humanitarian , it is a self - interested attempt to stem the tide, put a thumb in the dyke, and avoid the emergent chaos in the Middle East .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It would be better if the Lebanese had the magnamity, or much more importantly, the capacity , to continue simply receiving all Syrians , but they are barely running their own country .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Compassion requires an orderly method and capacities in order to be effectively pursued , i.e the Lebanese need a functioning state of their own to handle such a crisis properly .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  Lebanon has mostly escaped the wars next door not out of wisdom or discipline, or any energetic international diplomacy, but because the memories of that conflict are still vivid in the minds of Lebanese adults .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No one will go to war because they remember what war costs , and because they know how little they derived from the devastation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The result of 15 years of fighting was that the state was further weakened in favour of sectarianism, cronyism and corruption , while the Lebanese kept on doing what they do best, make money and enjoy life , living for today and certainly not tomorrow .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile ,  social and environmental erosion make the country less and less livable by the day .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The recent steps however, triggered by political challenges and health risks , signal some early and feeble attempts at a return of the state , or at the very least preserving the semblance of the old order, the shadow of a nation-state, amidst the dark fluidity and chaos surging from there to Kurdistan .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"With a Shia-led government in Baghdad, young Shia were beginning to recognise the army as a friendly institution .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The collapse of Iraqi army divisions in northern and western Iraq in June 2014 dented the army's reputation, with recent victories being credited to the predominately-Shia popular mobilisation militias (al-Hashd al-Shaabi) or else the tiny cadre of special forces - the so-called Golden Division .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a critical year for the Iraqi army , which is in danger of losing its status as the nation's premier armed force .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2009 , when the US-led ""train and equip"" effort reached its zenith , the Iraqi army fielded 55 combat brigades with approximately 210,000 troops .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Iraqi Ministry of Interior (MoI) fielded around 30 smaller brigades , totaling around 120,000 troops .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today the Iraqi army fields 40 weak brigades with a total combat strength of around 48,000 troops .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In contrast ,  the MoI survived the summer comparatively well and now fields 24 brigades , totaling around 36,000 troops .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The gap has narrowed between the two security ministries .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to the army and MoI, there are two other security forces that are on the rise .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One is the Popular Mobilisation forces , which seem to field approximately 100,000 troops, including a well-trained offensive cadre of around 20,000 fighters .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The final potential force is the National Guard that is being considered as an option by Iraqi politicians .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This force would, in theory, be trained, equipped and paid by the federal government , whilst being recruited and operated by the provincial councils .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a step towards this concept, a 5,000-strong US-equipped Tribal Security Force brigade has been provided with $13.5 million worth of US weapons and training in the new US Department of Defense budget .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is now up to Iraq's government whether the country will pay these troops as part of the first National Guard units in the forthcoming 2015 budget .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is also unclear exactly which ministry would administer the training, equipping and paying of National Guard troops: the US-backed Ministry of Defense (MoD) under Minister Khalid al-Ubeidi, a Sunni from Mosul, or the MoI , led by Badr leader Mohammed Ghabban, a close lieutenant of Badr leader Hadi al-Amiri .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The scheme could become a way of permanently employing the Popular Mobilisation forces in the National Guard units of the predominately-Shia southern provinces .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the Kurdish Peshmerga representing another large force of around 54 brigades with 113,000 troops , the Iraqi army is thus on-track to become one of the smaller security forces in Iraq .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More units will follow in the coming months .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If the US follows through on its pledges of training and equipment , the Iraqi army could survive its disastrous year in 2014 and play a key role in the struggle to evict Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forces from cities like Mosul, Tikrit, Ramadi and Fallujah .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Iraqi army can draw on some illustrious history .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1973, it deployed 18,000 troops with 300 tanks to save Damascus during the ""October War"" : this feat, mustering and moving an army 1,200km in just six days, remains deeply impressive .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Iraq's five lightning offensives in April, May and June of 1988 shattered the Iranian army and were textbook examples of planning and execution .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If the Iraqi army can be rebuilt with Shia, Sunni Arab and Kurdish political support , and if the well-led Ministry of Defense can guide the National Guard initiative , the coming year could witness new Iraqi army victories at Mosul .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Successful operations undertaken by this national institution, with deep roots in the Iraq's history, will be far more beneficial to the country than victories scored solely by Shia militias or local Sunni uprisings, either of which could further fracture Iraq .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Times quotes Marshallese Foreign Minister Tony de Brum on the seemingly parallel threats to survival : ""What would it gain mankind to reach a peaceful resolution of the climate change threat , only to be wiped out by a nuclear misunderstanding?""  There are certainly common denominators between climate change and nukes - not least that both are filed away in many of our brains under the category of things that we know can swiftly destroy us but would prefer not to think about .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  there appears to be a missing link in de Brum's analysis , because you can't resolve the climate change threat without resolving the business of imperial militarism , in both its nuclear and non-nuclear varieties .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In the early hours of December 24, 2014, mere days after the attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, a worn-out and exhausted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif took to the airwaves .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He had just concluded a marathon ten hour meeting with the chief of army staff of Pakistan and he came to the public with some new measures that would be undertaken to ensure that an attack like the Peshawar massacre would never happen again .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most notable and controversial of these was the establishment of special military courts that would try terror suspects for the next two years .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the opinion of the prime minister, and several other political parties, this measure , which would take power away from Pakistan's civilian judiciary , was necessary to win the fight against terror .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is no secret that Pakistani civilian courts have themselves been targets of terror .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just nine months before Peshawar, on March 3, 2014 two suicide bombers unleashed their mayhem inside the District Court complex in Islamabad .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Once inside, they lobbed grenades and fired bullets , people scrambled everywhere, papers flew and bodies fell .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As happens in the aftermath of every one of the hundreds of bombings that have taken place in Pakistan this year , the attack on the District Court in Islamabad was claimed by one of the terror groups operating in Pakistan .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like the Army Public School attack that would come months later , the aftermath of carnage was grotesque, the bits and pieces of the instruments of justice, papers of pleadings, the black jackets worn by lawyers, spread all over what had become a crime scene .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Attacks on courts are not the only problem in the adjudication of terrorism cases .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terror suspects, in the cases where they are even apprehended , are rarely tried let alone convicted .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the war on terror has trundled on , Pakistan's Court system has lacked the security or the power to conduct terrorism trials and produce convictions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In numbers obtained from 2012, it was found that the conviction rate for terrorism cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province , where many attacks were concentrated , was a paltry 4 percent .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Punjab, the situation was not much better .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In 2012 the Special Anti-Terrorism Court in that province heard 559 cases against terror suspects and 414 of these ended with acquittals .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to Khurram Khan, a Deputy Special Prosecutor, ""Witnesses have a high rate of recanting because of fear or threats in kidnapping for ransom cases  [...] Very few people come forward . Since we don't have a witness protection program , they change their statements.""  In more high profile cases, the witnesses face death threats .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Between 1990 and 2009, a time when Pakistan suffered thousands of terrorist attacks and suicide bombings, the acquittal rate in terror cases was 74 percent .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The establishment of military courts for a period of two years is supposed to be a solution to all of this .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If the military that is bombing terrorist hideouts in the north of the country is also given the task of adjudicating the cases , the new logic goes , terrorists will certainly be punished and tragedies like Peshawar will never happen again .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is a false premise .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  it is not the first time that military courts have been established in Pakistan , subverting and sidelining the country's already ailing civilian courts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On October 17, 1979 not long after General Zia ul Haq took over the country in a military coup , military courts were established (along with a ban on political activity and a muzzling of the Press) .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The decisions of these closed courts could not be challenged in any civilian courts and once that court was established , any matter could be transferred to its jurisdiction .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result, over one hundred such courts were established .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The powers they gave to the military allowed large-scale arrests and detentions of political workers and journalists .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hundreds of people were flogged and imprisoned simply for participating in normal political activity that was banned under martial law .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the present case, martial law has not been declared in Pakistan ; however ,  turning over the adjudication of terror cases undoubtedly undermines the country's civilian judiciary .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  the secrecy surrounding military courts leaves them open to charges of contravening legal principles and pursuing their own vendettas against this or that terrorist group instead of sticking to the principles of justice and obtaining convictions via fair procedures .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given that military courts in Pakistan do not work under a system of legal precedent , little information exists as to the basis of convictions and acquittals .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moreover , since evidence is rarely made public , plenty of room is created for conspiracy theorists to place doubt on any conviction that is produced under their auspices .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A confused Pakistani public , whose anti-imperialist fervour often leads it to championing extremist outfits against what it perceives as US meddling , desperately needs to see the evidence against terror suspects .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is only when the procedures for doing so are clear and transparent that the hearts and minds vulnerable to conspiracy theories that blame foreign hands will be forced to confront extremism as a home grown issue .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The aftermath of every terror attack sees a burgeoning of just this sort of denial, whetted and promoted by groups themselves ; the consequent moral murkiness makes it impossible for a Pakistani public to see terrorism as a black and white issue .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is only where the evidence against the evil masterminds of blasts and bombings is openly available and fairly presented will it be impossible to ignore .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second , the low conviction rate in civilian courts is a problem ; but it is one that can and should have been solved by providing protection to adjudicators, witnesses and other parties instead of rendering civilian courts altogether irrelevant .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Pakistani army undoubtedly possesses the capability to do this and does it regularly for its own leaders .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similarly civilian security outfits regularly protect police officials, Parliamentarians and other office holders , all of whom roam the country with heavy security cordons that are not available to lawyers, judges and witnesses in terror cases .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally ,  the establishment of military courts resurrects the old military- civilian schism from the dregs of Pakistani history and leaves the issue of extremism languishing in the middle .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The memory of the old military courts and their excesses against pro democracy agitators and writers who opposed martial law may be distant but is not forgotten .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The scepticism of the military and its machinations refreshed by this latest announcement is something that will only weaken what should be in Pakistan a united front against extremism .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The old narrative of pro-democracy activists harassed by military courts can easily be hijacked by today's extremists , who can present themselves as similarly beleaguered and innocent , their convictions illegitimate because they were handed down by military courts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the shoulders of such familiar manipulations, they will not be condemned convicts but heroes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terror is a people's problem in Pakistan, with nearly a thousand deaths in over 372 attacks just this year .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The extremists who are wreaking this havoc must be accountable to the people, via judicial institutions that serve the public .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The evidence has to be seen by all and the rules made plain and clear .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The last few days in global finance have been marked by dramatic developments in the energy sector .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oil prices have collapsed by about 40 percent since this year's peak in June .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The plummeting oil prices have had negative consequences on economies across the world, from Moscow to Caracas to Tehran .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The situation is particularly bad in Russia where the shock of shrinking energy revenue is doubled by a monetary crisis .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Balancing an oil-dependent budget .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The energy crisis has its origin in a global surplus of crude oil supply resulting from a rapid expansion of oil production in the US .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to dissuade additional investments in production of shale oil and tar sands in North America, and wedge a war on market shares , Saudi Arabia has voluntarily gone far above its previous OPEC production commitment .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some have seen this move as a plot by the Americans to punish countries like Iran and Russia .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  the sharp decrease in oil prices to $60 per barrel is far below the breakeven point for countries such as Venezuela and Iran who need $140 per barrel to balance their budget and continue with their policies of social spending and subsidised imports of vital goods .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Russian economy is also very vulnerable to such price fluctuations as the energy sector accounts for about half of the state's revenues and a quarter of its gross domestic product .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Putin's gamble to assume that the West would not confront him over Ukraine because of energy security concerns was a miscalculation of the forces at play .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The shrinking oil revenues coupled with the economic sanction packages have destroyed investors' confidence in the Russian economy , resulting in record levels of capital flight and a plunging rouble .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to the Russian ministry of economic development , food prices in Russia will increase by 12 percent by the end of this year , and conservative estimates for the first months of 2015 already set inflation at 10 percent .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

December 9 marks the six-month anniversary of ISIL's capture of Mosul .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Coverage of the low level civil war in Iraq had long disappeared off the front pages with a war weary western public happy to be ""out"" of a complex conflict that seemed to have no end .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The boldness of ISIL's sweep through the region and the taking of Mosul was the trigger that sparked a new focus on Iraq and put US warplanes back in the sky , but the city itself was quickly forgotten .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today, Mosul is a city on death row enduring both a terrible present and the potential of a worse future .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Initial ideas of a swift retaking of the city were dispelled by the ousting of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and the emergence of US President Barack Obama's anti-ISIL coalition .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ISIL has proved to be a resilient opponent and while its march forward has been held up in Kobane , Mosul remains under the black flag .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In November, Deputy Governor of Mosul Nuraddin Kaplan said that ""the sooner the operation begins the better . The more time that passes , the harder it will become"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Moves to retake Mosul are in the pipeline but I would argue that the priority should be given to the strategy of prompting a collapse from within as opposed to a destructive attempt to take it by force .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ISIL's predecessors, ""al-Qaeda in Iraq"", struggled to turn from capturing large urban areas to governing them and reports out of Mosul would suggest a similar trend is at play .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What information there is that manages to come out paints a bleak picture under ISIL rule .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In October, the Guardian reported ""severe shortages of food and water, no functioning public institutions, and the local economy in a state of near collapse"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The school system has been ""ISIL-ed"" with an education tax imposed , genders segregated and subjects such as art banned .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Christian homes and Shia shrines have reportedly been looted and displaced residents of Mosul testified to Al - Monitor that ISIL had arrested up to 25,000 people between June and October .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We've also learnt the ISIL-style of city governance elsewhere and in particular in Raqqa, their nominal capital .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An incredibly brave piece of citizen journalism shot by a resident in a hijab showed a city dominated by young, bearded men with guns on every street corner imposing both their ideas of urban management and social control .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prayer and conservative appearance is strictly enforced and executions, even crucifixions, are commonplace .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a bitter irony that residents of Raqqa have swapped one police state for another .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A smart strategy would seek to win Mosul from within .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ISIL's ability to attract disillusioned Iraqi Sunnis is being met by new Prime Minister Haider al-Abbadi's far more inclusive vision for the country .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Appointing a defence minister from Mosul and finally agreeing on an oil sharing agreement with the Kurds is evidence of this work in progress from the new premier .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abbadi's appeal to Iraqi nationalism and sensitivity to tribal and sectarian dynamics must be able to offer a bigger pull than the ISIL offer of a dysfunctional caliphate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Residents of ISIL-controlled Raqqa have spoken of feeling like ""strangers in their own city"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Effective propaganda can help split Iraqi members of ISIL from their often foreign leadership .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This won't be easy , reports have suggested that ISIL has decided to shut down most mobile telecommunications inside the city, perhaps conscious of the need to protect their battle for hearts and minds .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The alternative is far more dangerous for the city .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
US intelligence estimates that ISIL has the weapons to fight for two years .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The fate of Syria's second city, Aleppo, must serve as a warning as to the future of Iraq's second city, Mosul .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An effective and joined up political and military strategy led by Iraq's new government must make the residents of Mosul hate the caliphate and, at tremendous risk to themselves, take on ISIL from within rather than allow their city to become yet another Middle East urban graveyard .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Centring Muslim victims, instead of villains, would mitigate the backlash considerably .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition , focusing on the heroics of Merabat, instead of the evil of the three terrorists , asserts - and inserts - a competing narrative that France's Muslims are everyday citizens : Citizens with jobs, families, and interpretations of Islam that condemn violence, and contradict the malignant caricature of the faith constructed by the state .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ahmed Merabat was more than a victim .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was far more than merely a Muslim .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In fact ,  Obama said that if Sony had talked to him first , he would have told the company to show the film as planned .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Losing $45m in production costs for ""The Interview"" is nothing compared to Sony's potential liability if some catastrophe occurred at a showing of the film in Los Angeles or Washington, DC .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not to say that there are no foreign policy implications of this debacle .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sony's decision to make a comedy about the assassination of the North Korean head of state was a terrible idea that has only worsened the US' already terrible relations with this very unstable nuclear-armed nation .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Even by the standards of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the Palestinian Authority's just-thwarted attempt at a UN Security Council resolution was a spectacular waste of time, and needlessly handed Israel a symbolic diplomatic victory .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The draft  - which called for peace with Israel within a year, and an end to the occupation by 2017 - fell one yes vote short of the minimum nine required in the 15-member Council .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Draft resolutions are usually preceded by consultations with Council members, so whoever submits them knows, beforehand , which way the vote will go .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In fact ,  insufficient support among Council members was the initial reason given months ago by the PA for a delay in the vote .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As such, it must have known prior to presenting the draft that it would fail , so why go through with it?  In fact ,  why did the PA try to push through a resolution in the first place? Even if it mustered the minimum votes , the US would have used its veto , and the PA knew it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not only have the Americans consistently scuppered any resolution that places even the slightest criticism or pressure on Israel , but Washington had been explicit about its intention to use its veto this time round if necessary .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As such, it is puzzling that Jordan's UN Ambassador Dina Kawar , whose country submitted the draft with the backing of the PA and the Arab League , said she thought Council members should have had more time to discuss the proposal .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What would be the point in the face of an assured American veto?  The only way Washington would acquiesce was if the resolution called for an end to the Palestinian occupation of Israel .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This makes PA President Mahmoud Abbas's recent statement that he had repeatedly postponed the resolution due to US pressure equally puzzling .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Did he actually think anything he could say or do would lead to the US dropping such pressure , or that it would accept the draft that was presented?  In any case, months of consultations and various reasons for delays only resulted in the continued watering down of the text .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Among the most prominent critics is the widely popular senior Fatah figure Marwan Barghouti , whose party dominates the PA and includes Abbas .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Barghouti described the text as an ""unjustified fallback which will adversely affect the Palestinian position"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moreover ,  the draft was not put forward as a Chapter VII resolution , which would entail punitive measures for lack of compliance .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As such , even if it was passed , Israel  - which flatly condemned the PA's push from the outset - would be free to ignore it without consequence , as it has done with all the numerous Security Council resolutions over the decades .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  the draft did not contain any wording that would cause Israel to worry .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given that the US veto shields Israel , and that existing resolutions are ignored with impunity , it is astounding that the PA had any faith left in the Council to attempt its latest futile exercise at statehood .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even the response of its UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour was telling in this regard ; ""The Security Council has once again failed to uphold its charter duties to address this crises and to meaningfully contribute to a lasting solution in accordance with its own resolutions.""  It has long been clear that the UN is a highly unlikely place for Palestinians to seek justice , as the consistent wishes and support of the international community for their cause is held hostage by just one country .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The very notion of Security Council vetoes makes the UN an inherently and woefully undemocratic institution .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, had the gall to say the resolution undermined efforts to ""achieve two states for two people"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The entire point of the resolution was to create a state that the existing state is determined to deny .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As such, one wonders if she even read the draft .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems the mere mention of Israel automatically triggers an American veto .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This whole months-long affair was an obvious exercise in futility , during which time Israel has further entrenched its occupation and colonisation of Palestine .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most commentators place an emphasis on the possible role external factors have played in this act of terrorism .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Various external factors are cited , but they mostly focus on the conflicts in the Middle East and international tensions in general, in a bid to link the Paris attacks to extremist ideologies that promote such murderous acts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A week after the attack, the French political class and key media outlets remain focused on the security aspect and barely attempt to address the issue from a different angle .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They do not question the responsibility held by French society and state - as well as the role of the socioeconomic policies practised by successive French governments - in addressing the woes of the socially marginalised and disenfranchised zones from which the Kouachi brothers sprang .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How can this act be attributed only to dogmatic ideological motivations and grievances over international conflicts, given that the religious and ideological indoctrination process is too complicated to be attributed solely to external factors?  As both French officials and analysts respond with emotion , they ignore a series of socioeconomic factors that have fuelled the motivations of the actors .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is important to remember that the perpetrators of the attack were born and raised in France in a poor, disadvantaged area where unemployment rates among the youth aged 18 to 24 years reaches 45 percent (compared to the national rate which is nearly 10 percent) .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In these areas, called ""banlieues"" , state infrastructure is almost non - existent and the population is subject to segregation and racial discrimination in terms of access to employment opportunities and housing , which in most cases leads to exclusion from the civic sphere .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2006, an official case study focusing on access to employment conditions showed that 51 percent of young French candidates are subject to discrimination based on ethnic origin and/or skin colour .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These conditions result in social marginalisation and promote delinquency which in turn raises the chances of incarceration ; a place where religious indoctrination and ideological radicalisation mostly occur .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sociologist Robert Castel describes the situation of young people in these deprived areas as follows : ""These young people are not completely [living] outside of society , however ,  they are not inside it either , for they do not enjoy any recognised space/role  [...] Their situation is pretty paradoxical : they are citizens , who live on French territory , and yet they undergo differential and discriminatory treatment that disqualifies them . The republic, in contradiction with its own principles, seems incapable of integrating these young French people who live like the indigenous minority of the nation.""  This, combined with a conflicting social context that is constantly fuelled by debates over identity , religion and behavioural issues (such as the debate on national identity, the veil, halal food in schools, Islam and French secularism) further stigmatise this community and place it in a permanent state of confrontation with the rest of society .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This vicious cycle prevents any change in the dynamics of this relationship into a cooperative one that could help find solutions in order to improve their socioeconomical status .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention the mainstream media discourse permanently framing those zones and communities as an ailment to the society .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Such dynamics only complicate the relationship with the government, often seen as an opponent and sometimes as an enemy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the gap where religious indoctrination factors sneaks in - often occurring in prison environments where ethnic groups are predominantly from these areas and where 18- to 30 -year-olds represent 35 percent of the incarcerated population .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are these good enough reasons to explain the motives behind committing such a terrorist act? Of course not .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the conditions described above constitute the factors that facilitate and accelerate the ideological and religious indoctrination process .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Especially when protagonists have the financial resources (this is often the case) to attract the most fragile, the most helpless and the most excluded in order to step forward and enrol in extremist activities , the international context helps .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With such a grim reality, the question going forward would be if purely security measures are sufficient to challenge the terrorism that threatens France .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""France is at war against terrorism and against radical Islam,"" he said .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Exceptional measures will be taken to challenge terrorism.""  Valls mentioned exclusively security measures, such as reinforcing supervision within the prisons where Islamist prisoners are concentrated ; establishing inter-European border controls ; strengthening international intelligence cooperation ... however ,  there was no mention of a possible revision of the government's social policies to address the problems in the marginalised zones; no announcement of a reflection on a possible serious debate to propose a new approach to address all the socioeconomic ills affecting them .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The security measures announced by the prime minister are necessary, but not sufficient to contain terrorism ; the roots of extremism , where the first frustrations are formed , remain untouched .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is not to say that the French government should be solely held responsible for the situation which France is facing today .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nevertheless ,  failing to take into account the catastrophic socioeconomic factor would be tantamount to promoting the very context that contributes to the development of fundamentalist ideologies .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The government urgently needs to review its social and economic policies towards these disadvantaged areas , developing real socioeconomic infrastructure, strengthening solidarity, emphasising the fight against discrimination in employment and housing, strengthening anti-racist laws and promoting a fairer media discourse towards these populations in order to improve their lot in life .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The beginning of ethical credibility is to insist upon consistency .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Either Rushdie and France have to abide by the unsavoury views of Dieudonne as well as those of Charlie Hebdo or it should suppress them both .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If it allows both then it is opting for the Rushdie view that members of a modern society must learn to live with the extremes of cultural freedom even if hurtful .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"At present, Mexico suffers from an extremely weak state where the vast majority of crimes go unaddressed because of a judicial vacuum .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More than 22,000 forced disappearances have occurred since 2007 and more than 70,000 people have been killed since 2006 .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Mexico also suffers from the third largest illicit economy in the world, according to the Global Financial Integrity Report .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Clearly, organised crime is openly challenging and fragmenting the state .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the face of these facts even President Nieto has admitted in public speeches that Mexico's legal system is in shambles .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
International experience and basic common sense indicate that a country must possess a minimum standard of the rule of law in order to be able to foster social benefits for most of its population when privatising state assets .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Without functional regulatory and judicial controls, it is technically and politically not feasible for any oil-funded social development fund to effectively spread wealth to future generations through new public education programmes, a modernised public health, adequate environmental standards and a much-improved physical infrastructure .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Absolutely nothing today indicates that Mexico can implement privatisation of the oil infrastructure at even the most basic standards of security, transparency, effectiveness and efficiency .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  a Mexican paradox occurs .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While insecurity still runs at record highs , foreign money keeps pouring in .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What's going on? Since the beginning of the still unfinished democratic transition and since the economic opening to international trade of the early 1990s, Mexico managed to attract billions of dollars per year in foreign direct investment .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  most of this money has been channelled into politically managed non-competitive sectors in the hands of Mexican ""state courtesans"" disguised as private entrepreneurs who over the last 25 years created vast oligopolies out of the privatisation of state assets .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The privatisation process in Mexico has largely been conducted through dubious procedures orchestrated by corrupt federal governments .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All this happened in the midst of a Mexican economy lacking technological innovation with low productivity and where more than half of what is produced and consumed is exchanged within informal/illicit markets .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nevertheless ,  these so-called private oligopolies within the mining, banking and telecommunications industries operate in a crony capitalistic fashion by attracting foreign investors to politically protected markets in which governments (through bribes and subsidies) ensure rates of return two to five times above the international average .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How can, for example, German or US oligopolies presently investing in Mexico fail to fall in love with such a ""generous"" corrupt system?  The forthcoming Mexican oil privatisation falls comfortably within this ""legally corrupt"" economic framework .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Moreover ,  with thorough documentation, Ms Perez provides a detailed account of how and where a large portion of the oil extracted and distributed by PEMEX is currently stolen through illegal operations .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These have been linked to Mexican politicians and US and Mexican private companies selling illegal Mexican oil to the markets in Canada, Mexico and the US , with the complicity of the Mexican armed forces supposedly responsible for protecting the PEMEX infrastructure .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The current illegal oil trafficking comes with high-level political corruption, intense armed conflict causing thousands of deaths per month and frequent acts of terrorism against the PEMEX infrastructure .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One cannot expect this armed conflict scenario to just go away after privatisation .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this kind of context, any honest foreign investor bidding within a Mexican oil privatisation process should have his or her head checked or otherwise possess enough political clout within Mexico or the financial capacity to bribe with millions of dollars the government ladder and pay for a vast praetorian guard of security personnel to manage the armed chaos ahead .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In comparison , dealing with other oil producing countries with problematic states, such as Nigeria , would seem like a walk in the park .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shareholders of oil companies can only expect low economic returns and chaos from investing in the Mexican oil sector , unless , prior to any private investment drive, an international judicial cooperation effort starts dismantling the vast organised crime networks within the Mexican oil business and beyond .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This international judicial cooperation must entail the actual implementation of a serious anti-corruption programme within the Mexican state with much broader conflict of interest and traffic of influence statutes , all monitored by reputable international civil society organisations .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore ,  the failure of the Mexican state needs to be corrected with the installation of autonomous investigative units for economic crimes within each Mexican region and the creation of witness protection programmes for cases of political corruption linked to organised crime .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In this context, it makes perfect sense that investment should be redirected from the botched South Stream project to the upgrade of Blue Stream .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The AKP government has helped decrease imports from Russia to 57 percent of the overall volume , but in absolute terms, consumption in an expanding economy like Turkey's is only going higher .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Luckily, the plummeting prices of oil have come as a huge bonus to the government , reducing Turkey's bill and improving the balance of payments vis-a-vis Russia .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What Turkey is offering in exchange is neutrality in Putin's confrontation with the West .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ankara has a lot of reasons to be unhappy about the annexation of Crimea, home to a large Tatar community which views Turkey as a kin state , and about the frozen conflict in Eastern Ukraine .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The strategic value of Turkey's neutrality has only gone up after Putin found himself shouldered aside by most emerging powers at the recent G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia has long encouraged Turkey's pursuit of an autonomous foreign policy and emancipation from NATO and the US .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the Turkish city of Antalya hosts the next G20 summit , there will be a renewed emphasis on Turkey's transformation into a global leader rather than a pliant western periphery .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"There are some voices that have been conspicuously absent since the publication of Sabrina Rubin Erdely's Rolling Stone article ""A Rape on Campus: A Brutal Assault and a Struggle for Justice at UVA."" Administrators at UVA were forced to respond to the allegations of a 2012 gang rape at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity , and women came out in force to share their stories of sexual violence on campus .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Erdely received so much testimony from women on the UVA campus about the rape culture that she wrote a follow-up article ""Rape at UVA : Readers Say Jackie Wasn't Alone."" However ,  the fraternities on campus have been silent as a whole .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And this is not only a UVA problem - rape culture, often cantered in the hypermasculine environment of fraternities, is an epidemic at colleges across the US .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gregory Orr , who has taught at UVA for the past 39 years , argued : ""Fraternity culture is about as deeply implicated in misogyny and other prejudicial evils as you can imagine.""  In September, New York Magazine ran a feature ""Meet the College Women Who Are Starting a Revolution Against Campus Sexual Assault"" that included the story of Emma Sulkowicz .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She is a Columbia University student who, in response to being raped and seeing inaction on the part of her university to seek justice , strapped a mattress to her back and vowed to walk around campus until her rapist was expelled .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Women like Sulkowicz and Jackie (the victim at UVA) are insulted, mistreated, and ignored by the university administration until they take their stories public .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In many of these stories of sexual violence, the victims are transformed into activists .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IFC should take this moment to promote open dialogue about sexual violence , and this requires admitting that the documented culture of sexual violence in fraternities has validity , and that fraternity brothers have been complicit in a culture that shames and silences rape victims .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Across the board denial of any mistreatment of women seems to be the modus operandi of fraternities .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One fraternity brother at UVA agreed to speak to me as long as I didn't use his name or identify his fraternity .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

India projects itself as a target of Islamic terrorism perpetrated by home- grown Indian Mujahideen (IM) or Pakistan-based outfits particularly in India- administered Kashmir essentially to garner sympathy internationally and unite the population .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latest Global Terrorism Index released by international think tank Institute of Economics and Peace reveals that while jihadists were responsible for 15 percent of terrorism-related killings in India ; Maoists accounted for the lion's share of casualties - a whopping 50 percent - in 2013 .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The remaining 35 percent of deaths were caused by guerillas fighting for statehood or independence in states like Assam, Manipur and Nagaland .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Armed group, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) , which gunned down 75 Adivasis, or tribespeople, just before Christmas in its diabolical pursuit of a separate homeland for ethnic Bodos in Assam , was on the government's radar for a long time .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The carnage provoked an uncompromising crackdown by the Indian army but thereby hangs a grim tale of political expediency .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Syed Asif Ibrahim, Intelligence Bureau director, seemed to have a premonition of the massacre .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He pointed out that NDFB has become one of the deadliest separatist outfits in business at the IB's 49th annual conference in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Interior Minister Rajnath Singh in Assam's largest city, Guwahati, last month .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He observed that one option before the government was to bring NDFB to the negotiating table .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At present, though, negotiations are out of the question .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Singh could well have cited another instance of sheer savagery - a seven-year - old boy was shot seven times in his foot, thigh, abdomen, hand and face  - to build a stronger case for the clampdown which surprised many .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Clearly, lightning action by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led federal government was in sharp contrast to the nationalist party's known stand on Bodo violence .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The BJP didn't shed tears when NDFB shot dead 50 Bengali-speaking Muslims in May .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the party's own poll campaign then underway accused Bangladeshi Muslims of ""destroying"" India .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the killings jelled with the BJP's political rhetoric; just days before the May butchery , Modi declared that Bangladeshis must keep their ""bags packed"" for deportation if he captured power .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similarly , when NDFB slaughtered nearly a 100 Muslims and displaced half a million in July-August 2012 , senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani immediately extended moral support to the Bodos .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He publicly argued that the blood-bath was the result of a silent Bangladeshi demographic invasion straining resources and creating insecurity among Bodos .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The party also organised a seminar in New Delhi on ""Bodo Hindus - Refugees in their own land: Bangladeshi Muslim infiltrators - the new kingmakers in an Indian state"" with then BJP president, Nitin Gadkari, as a key speaker .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But decoding the BJP's somersault is pretty easy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NDFB killing Muslims and forcing terrified survivors into hellish refugee camps was par for the course as far as BJP was concerned .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But training their guns on Adivasis was a blunder NDFB will regret for a long time .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The BJP immediately let loose the army on NDFB to repay a big debt of gratitude and regain Adivasi goodwill crucial for wresting Assam from the Congress Party in the 2016 state assembly elections .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Adivasis , who account for almost 20 percent of Assam's voters , ditched the Congress Party in this year's parliamentary elections and supported the BJP giving the party seven seats compared to four in 2009 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The party's Adivasi candidates, Rameshwar Teli and Kamakhya Prasad Tasa, trounced Congress MPs in Dibrugarh and Jorhat .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The BJP's vote-share rose to 36.6 percent from 16.21 percent thanks to Adivasis  - which also explains the BJP's muscular response to the December 23 massacre .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In a sense Bodos were tempting fate for a long time .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They constitute barely six percent of Assam's 33 million population but want half of the state for themselves .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They chose the path of terror way back in 1987 with the slogan ""Divide Assam 50-50"" leaving behind a trail of murder and mayhem .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The first tripartite peace treaty between the federal government, state government and Bodos was signed in 1993 but it collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another accord signed in 2003 resulted in the Bodo Territorial Autonomous District (BTAD) giving them considerable autonomy .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BTAD covering around 8,795 square-km area was given to Bodos on a platter although they comprised only 20 percent of the population in BTAD .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rest are predominantly Muslims  - many of whom are migrants from Bangladesh - and Adivasis .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bodos floated a political party called Bodoland People's Front (BPF) to administer BTAD , but armed groups, such as Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT) and NDFB with their extremist-supremacist agenda, called the shots .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was a bizarre case of 20 percent ruling over 80 percent!  Because Bodos didn't enjoy numerical majority , they resorted to ethnic cleansing .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And whether their targets were Muslims or Adivasis , Bodos invariably inflicted more casualties than they suffered primarily because they didn't surrender their arms as they were supposed to after the 2003 accord .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now the army's brief is to defang NDFB by snatching their guns before eliminating them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The political motive behind the crackdown is crystal clear .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even otherwise, Singh, the interior minister, is increasingly realising the consequences of armed groups having a free run .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Earlier this month he flew to Raipur, capital of Chattisgarh state , after Maoists killed 14 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers in cold blood .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Singh wanted to visit the ambush site about 450km from Raipur .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But security forces warned him that Maoists were capable of bringing down his helicopter! So Singh couldn't make his way to the blood-soaked Ground Zero literally in the centre of India - a sad commentary on a nuclear nation's internal security scenario .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are many unanswered questions about the TTP .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How big is the group? Have its ties to the Pakistani intelligence agencies become stronger since Mullah Fazlullah, of Swat fame, became its leader, given his own past affiliation with Pakistan's powerful spy agency ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence)? Or is the group closer now to other foreign funders?  The absence of convincing answers to such questions has resulted in ongoing debates on the appropriate response to this horror .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From US-backed media personalities supporting the establishment of concentration camps for entire populations in some parts of the tribal areas, to the broadening of ongoing military operations , the overwhelming thrust among many vocal commentators has been for countering this violence with more violence .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  there is also a deep scepticism about a primarily military response within the Pakistani society , which is why successive governments have been secretive about such operations .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite repeated calls for stronger military action by the US government and also many influential commentators within Pakistan, there is widespread suspicion that these army operations end up killing more civilians than militants .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is easy, but completely misleading , to write off this widespread scepticism about military responses to the Taliban violence as driven by sympathetic sentiments or worse , as the inability of Pakistanis to face the hard facts of home-grown terror .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We must recognise that it is a mistrust borne of experience with the military's role in Pakistani politics .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More critically , we need to recognise the long-term impact of the Pakistani state's support for the ""war on terror"" and its operations in the tribal areas over the last decade .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is a growing sense of deprivation and discrimination among Pashtuns across the country , and further state violence in the region has to be carefully weighed against the very real possibility of serious backlash .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While we all agree that there must be a response to these atrocities , for it to be effective , both at the state and societal level , it is imperative that it is calibrated to the level of threat posed by wide range of groups contained within the category ""Taliban"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All four are a direct result of the chaos created by the US' war in the region and the supply of drugs, arms and men that such a war invariably engenders .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But these four groups all require different responses .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The local defence militias can be ignored for now .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The mercenaries and criminals need to be treated precisely as that : controlling and managing their sources of incomes or in some cases, completely eroding them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  the first two groups require a much broader and more complex response .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is, unfortunately, no short-cut to political transparency that is required for their dismantling .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aggressive and persistent public questioning and scrutiny of Pakistani generals and politicians associated with the state funded militia, as well as their support for the ""war on terror"" in the region , is the only viable strategy available to citizens of Pakistan for a lasting resolution .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this context, the religious vs secular binary is completely artificial .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most secular generals of the Pakistani army have been happy to support some versions of Taliban as well as to benefit financially and politically by supporting the US war in the region .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A key step in this direction has to be the demand for greater information about the militants who attacked the school in Peshawar .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although TTP has claimed responsibility for the tragedy , it is important to establish who precisely is involved .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How did they get past the three check points in the defence colony where the school is located? Which cities/villages did the militants who were killed come from? How does that correspond to the profiles of the attackers in the past? Where is that information about past attackers anyway? What are their organisational careers and educational backgrounds? Where are their families , and what can they tell us about the path their sons took?  Calling on the very same generals to carry out military operations against the operatives they have supported and created is surely a strategy fraught with contradictions, though favoured by some vocal analysts and by the US government .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The collective punishment of the people of the tribal areas as a ""solution"" may appeal to some because of its deceptive simplicity , but it is an extremely dangerous strategy likely to further shred the fabric of Pakistani public life .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"However ,  the press after a brief period ignored the instructions and started using the word ""Crusade"" in discussing the occupation of Jerusalem .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"There was a clear urge to frame the colonisation project in Palestine in religious terms and view it as a continuation of the earlier Muslim-Christian conflict, despite claims of fighting the Ottomans on the basis of European secularism and anti-religious modernity .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The British were not the only ones thinking in these terms .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In his book The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihads and Modernity , Tariq Ali describes how the French commander Henri Gouraud upon entering Damascus with his troops , went to Saladin's tomb, kicked it and proclaimed ; ""The Crusades have ended now!

Poland's recent local elections went according to the usual script: The ruling coalition of the Civic Platform and Polish People's Party retained their control over major cities .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But there was one political surprise in the final results .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The urban movement , which ran for the first time in elections as a nationwide coalition of city activists , won the mayor's seat in Gorzow Wielkopolski, in western Poland, and a number of city council seats in big cities like Warsaw, Poznan and Torun .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Their demands ended up in the electoral programmes of mainstream political parties , which scrambled to attract grassroot activists on their lists to capture the youth leftist vote .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So what is this new political force and can it permanently transform Polish local and state politics?  In late 2007, a group of residents of the Rataje district in Poznan, in western Poland, organised to defend their right to have a say in the planning of their neighbourhood .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The mayor of Poznan and the city council, had proposed to transform the derelict post-industrial zone of the neighbourhood into a new residential and commercial area .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Local residents, on the other hand, insisted on building a park and a recreational area .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They mobilised the community, organised protests, wrote petitions and publicised the issue in the media .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The negative publicity made the situation uncomfortable enough for local officials to concede to public pressure and withdraw their commercial development proposal .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was the first sign that a new social force was emerging with the potential to affect urban policies in Poland through civic engagement .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grassroot activities began to surface in other Polish cities around that time .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Activists from Sopot in northern Poland started calling for participatory budgeting following the model of the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Gradually, these groups merged into a movement calling for citizen participation in the transformation of the post-industrial area of the city, just like in Poznan .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lodz used to be an important industrial centre up until 1989 when its textile industry collapsed and many industrial buildings lay abandoned and derelict .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Warsaw, urban activists organised demonstrations for the preservation of green areas in the centre of the Polish capital; against hikes in public transport fees,;and against privatisation of municipal buildings .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the last few years , groups like Right to the City, Inhabitants' Forum , and the Housing Movement have emerged in almost every Polish town bringing together individuals of various ages, social, and cultural backgrounds .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These groups were involved in a variety of campaigns to reassert residents' rights to their neighbourhoods and towns: from writing petitions, to organising protests, pickets and demonstrations, to occupying vacant buildings, setting up squats and blocking evictions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their political appetite grew with time .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2010, Poznan activists formed : ""We, the Inhabitants of Poznan,"" social electoral committee to contest local elections .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They received almost 10 percent of the votes , but with an electoral law favouring big political parties, they failed to get a seat on the council .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This electoral experience facilitated the launching, in 2011, of an informal coalition - the Urban Movements Congress - comprising urban activist groups from all over Poland .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The congress was tasked with formulating a programme to provide a common foundation around which urban activists would build their campaigns in local communities .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The programme was focused on three main pillars : policies to stem and reverse the growth of socioeconomic inequalities and exclusion; sustainable environment-conscious urban development in the interest of all residents; and promotion of direct democracy practices such as social consultations, participatory budgeting and referendums .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After the founding of the congress, the urban movements grew in strength and impact .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other mayors soon followed suit .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mayor of Lodz also invited local activists to advise the city council's Revitalisation Bureau on specific policies for the socioeconomic development of the city .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The reason why Lodz became more accepting of the urban movement's demands was because its previous mayor was removed in a popular referendum in January 2010 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The mayors of Czestochowa, Olsztyn, Elblag, Bytom and Ostroda were also removed in the same manner for introducing policies regarding privatisation and commercial development which went against the will of their electorates .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"After surviving in her post , she quickly implemented some of the urban movement's demands .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the most spectacular achievement of the Polish urban movement in recent months was putting Krakow's candidacy to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games to a referendum .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After it was announced in November 2013 that local authorities had decided to put forward Krakow's candidacy for the Olympics , activists launched a campaign called Krakow Against Games , which aimed to inform people of the negative consequences of hosting big sporting event .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"City authorities caved in under popular pressure and put the decision to a referendum, with the condition that it has at least a 30 percent turnout .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Knowing that the 2010 EU elections had only a 26 percent turnout , they combined the referendum with the 2014 EU elections .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To the displeasure of local authorities , some 36 percent of Krakow's citizens voted and 70 percent of those said no to the games .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Victory of the Krakow Against Games campaign showed that referendums can be an important tool in bringing local policies in line with residents' will and that urban activists have considerable social support .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Krakow victory gave impetus to the formation by of nationwide coalition of 12 sociopolitical entities affiliated with the Urban Movements Congress to contest the 2014 local elections .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The results of the election demonstrated that the movement can translate its grassroot support into electoral victories .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the 2015 parliamentary and presidential elections approaching, the coalition is hopeful that it will have an even larger political impact in the coming year .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The urban movement has a long way to go in order to occupy a permanent place on Poland's political map , but its public presence, successful campaigns and increasing social support show that there is a definite shift in Polish people's sociopolitical attitudes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is clearly growing support for sustainable and environment-conscious development which aims to level out inequalities and exclusion and usher in effective practices of direct democracy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In 1904, Russia and Japan went to war over control of the Liaodong Peninsula in modern day China .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia needed a year-round ice-free port for its naval fleet and Imperial Japan saw this encroachment as a threat .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After early setbacks in the war, Russia needed to quickly reinforce its naval fleet in the Pacific Ocean with its Baltic Fleet .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With its Baltic Fleet literally on the other side of the world, Russia's options were limited .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ice blocked the route along Russia's northern coastline - known today as the Northern Sea Route .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The British blocked access to the Suez Canal .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It finally took the Baltic Fleet seven months to get to the Sea of Japan via the Cape of Good Hope .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fleet arrived knackered and ill-prepared for battle .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On May 28, 1905, nearly the entire Russian fleet was destroyed during the Battle of Tsushima - Russia had no choice but to sue for peace .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If Arctic ice continues to decrease at its current rate it is possible Russia will not have this problem in the future .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each year more ships are making the journey through the Northern Sea Route .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In some cases this reduces the distance between European and north Asian ports by 30 percent .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While the economic advantages are obvious , the use of the Northern Sea Route offers military advantages as well .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia's interests in the Arctic go beyond the economic and military advantages offered by the Northern Sea Route .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The region is rich in minerals, wildlife, fish, and other natural resources .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some estimates claim that 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil reserves and almost one-third of the world's undiscovered natural gas reserves are located in the Arctic region .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The majority of these untapped resources are also in areas to which Russia lays claim .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For now , the Arctic region is an area of low conflict , and it is in everyone's interest to keep it that way .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although the security challenges currently faced in the Arctic are not military in nature , there is still a requirement for military capability in the region that can support civilian authorities .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example ,  civilian search and rescue and natural disaster response - in such an unforgiving environment as the Arctic - can be augmented by the military .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So it should be no surprise that like Russia, other Arctic countries deploy military assets into the region .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even so ,  Russia has taken steps to increase military capability in the region that seems to be beyond the scope of supporting civilian operations .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One must consider the implications of Russia's increased military presence in the region in light of Moscow's recent aggression against Ukraine .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This month, Russia activated its new Arctic command to better coordinate all Russian military activities in the Arctic .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ultimate goal for Russia to deploy a combined arms force in the Arctic by 2020 , appears to be on track .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia's primary military focus in the Arctic is in the maritime sphere .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A cause for concern .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Russian naval doctrine calls for Russia to increase its maritime presence in the Arctic .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Already, Russia's Northern Fleet , which is based in the Arctic , counts for two-thirds of the Russian navy .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There will be a significant increase of Russian ground troops based in the region too .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over the next few years two new so-called Arctic brigades will be permanently based above the Arctic Circle , and the current regiment of marines assigned to the Northern Fleet will increase by one-third .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia has plans to build 13 airfields as well as 10 radar posts along the course of the Northern Sea Route .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most of these airfields will be refurbished Soviet era bases , but others will be new .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Arctic is an area that allows Russia to flex its muscles without incurring any significant geopolitical risk .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because nationalism is on the rise in Russia , Putin's Arctic strategy is popular among the population .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russian activity in the Arctic , whether military, economic or scientific , harks back to images of Peter the Great and the Great Northern Expedition in the 18th century .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This helps Putin with his dream of bringing Russia back to its former imperial glory .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is Russia's prerogative to place military assets inside its national territory, however , these actions should be of concern to others in the region because Moscow has shown its willingness to use military force to achieve its national objectives outside its national borders .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is no secret that Russia views the South Caucasus as being in its natural sphere of influence .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In light of Russia's annexation of Crimea, and on the back of Moscow's recent treaties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgians have legitimate reasons to believe that Russian activity in their country will only increase in 2015 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Consequently ,  many are keeping a close eye on the Georgian province of Samtskhe-Javakheti - a majority ethnically Armenian region located just three hours' drive from the nation's capital city of Tbilisi .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Causing instability in Samtskhe-Javakheti would achieve two goals for Moscow .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  it would further dismember the territorial integrity of Georgia .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are already under Russian occupation .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By some accounts they are closer than ever to being annexed by Moscow .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An independent Samtskhe-Javakheti, or one under Russian influence, would divide Georgia down the middle .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Armenian separatism in Samtskhe-Javakheti might not be as vocal as it was only a few years ago ; but there is still a fear that Moscow could easily reenergise separatist movements in the region .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondly, and more importantly for Russia, bringing the region under Moscow's influence would make a land corridor between Russia and Armenia, via South Ossetia, one step closer .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is important because Russia maintains a sizeable military presence in Armenia .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The bulk of the Russian force is based in the city of Gyumri and consists of approximately 5,000 soldiers and dozens of fighter planes and attack helicopters .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia has long had the difficult challenge of supplying these forces , especially since Georgia and Turkey refuse transit rights .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This has left a reliance on Iran , which for obvious reasons, is not ideal for Russia .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is not only for Russia that Samtskhe-Javakheti is strategically important, but also for Europe .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the South Caucasus Pipeline , carrying oil and gas respectively from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea , passes through the province .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the possibility of more Central Asian oil and gas finding its way to Europe becomes likely , these pipelines bypassing Russia will become a vital part of Europe's energy security .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition ,  the Kars-Tbilisi-Baku railway , which is due to open later this year , passes through Samtskhe-Javakheti .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is expected that this rail line will eventually transport 3 million passengers and over 15 million tons of freight each year .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a perfect storm brewing in the region and if Russia wanted to exploit the situation in Samtskhe-Javakheti it could not ask for better timing than now .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First is the fact that many Javakheti Armenians have Russian sympathies .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Until its closure in 2007, the Russian military base there was the single biggest source of employment .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has also been reportedthat Moscow is issuing Russian passports to ethnic Armenians living in the region .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This in itself is telling ; Russia issued passports to Abkhazians and South Ossetians just before its 2008 invasion of Georgia and also issued passports to Crimeans ahead of the annexation of Crimea last year .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But Russia is only part of the problem .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many of the grievances Javakheti Armenians have are a result of poor policy making by the central government in Tbilisi .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many Javakheti Armenians feel that their culture and language are discriminated against .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There has been a decrease in the quality of education among the Javakheti Armenian population .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The bilingual education program of teaching in both Georgian and Armenian has been described as a ""total failure"" because there are not enough qualified teachers with proficiency in both languages .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unemployment is high in Samtskhe-Javakheti and future economic prospects in the region look bleak .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many Javakheti Armenians travel to Russia or Armenia for work .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Economy strained .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks to the drop in the value of the Russian ruble - almost one-third of its value in the past year  - remittances have also decreased .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The unusually harsh winter in the region is placing a further strain on economic activity .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then there is the issue of citizenship and immigration .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many Javakheti Armenians do not have Georgian citizenship .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead ,  many hold Armenian passports because finding seasonal work in Armenia and Russia is easier this way .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Until recently, Armenian citizens were allowed to live and work inside Georgia without any special authorisation as long as they crossed the border back into Armenia at least once a year .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last September this changed .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now Javakheti Armenians without Georgian citizenship can only stay in Georgia for three months at a time .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Longer term residency permits are costly .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These policies breed animosity and form a perfect storm that could easily be exploited by Russia .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It does not have to be this way .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sensible policies can be pursued by Tbilisi to address the legitimate grievances of the Javakheti Armenians .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The West can make it clear to Russia that further meddling in Georgia's domestic affairs could lead to additional sanctions .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You have to be made of wood not to laugh at this : a private Russian bank has given a loan to France's National Front .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This political party, drawn to victory by Marine Le Pen, won the recent French elections by almost three times the number of votes than President Francois Hollande .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although this is news , this wasn't the biggest media reaction of the day .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ever since the news came out that the National Front's campaign budget was allegedly funded by the First Czech-Russian Bank , accusations that ""the Kremlin is funding the far-right"" and ""supporting anti-EU parties"" have been making the rounds .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This bank has been in operation since 1996 , which by Russian terms, makes it ""ancient"" as capitalism didn't really kick in until the mid-1990s in Russia .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Through this, the sole owner of the bank, Roman Popov, was immediately seen as the ""oligarch who is close to the Kremlin"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The funding , which initially started at a sum of $11m , quickly increased to $49m , purely because that is the amount of money the National Front said it needed in order to pay for its campaign leading up to the presidential elections in 2017 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With all the media hype, it seems as though people haven't picked up on the irony .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was running for president in 2005 , Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi also gave him a sum of money for his campaign .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But that is not the irony ; the amount of money he gave was $49m .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This doesn't appear to have crossed the minds of western hacks just yet .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is because they have their own steadfast views and refuse to deviate from them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to find out more , I turned to my Moscow sources for help .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But first, I got in touch with the First Czech-Russian Bank .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wanted to find out what they thought about the whole fuss that has erupted around their institution .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the staff at the bank was reluctant to comment on the loan to the National Front , citing client confidentiality .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They did, however , provide me with a direct email address to get in touch with one of the deputy chairmen , who never did respond to my request for comment .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then again , if you should try to find out something somewhat unconventional from any of the private banks in the West , you'd also be met with silence or at best, claims of data protection .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My sources in Moscow did a bit of their own research and told me that the First Czech-Russian Bank was actually launched on the initiative of the Czech government .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At some point later on, one of the shareholders was the Russian construction company Stroitransgaz ; translated into English , the name means ""Gas Pipeline Construction"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The current owner of the bank, Roman Popov, used to work there .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While Popov was head of the Finance Department (1992-2002) , Stroitransgaz was a subcontractor for Gazprom, the giant state-owned gas and oil corporation in Russia .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was probably because of that , that western hacks came to the conclusion that Popov is ""directly linked to the Kremlin"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The journalists' suspicions are further fuelled by the fact that Popov generally keeps a low profile and does not boast about his football club in England or his basketball team in the US or his real-estate profile , which is worth millions in Western Europe .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The bank also has two representative offices; one in Prague and one in Bratislava , which would be logical if the name of your bank included the word ""Czech"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My sources in Moscow informed me that the First Czech-Russian bank is quite a good bank and has a very decent track record , which is no mean feat for a financial institution that dates back to 1996 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has had no substantial bail outs from the Central Bank and survived the banking crash of 2007 with flying colours .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As for the owner, the best I could find out is that he has a degree in financial management and has been of late developing business beyond corporate entities and individual customers in Russia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No word on why he gave the go-ahead to give the loan to the National Front , but even if he did , why not? If the interest is good and the chances of getting it back are high as well , it sounds like a fair deal .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not to mention that it's a perfectly legitimate political party , which enjoys greater support than the ruling party at present .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most recent opinion poll has shown that Le Pen would win the first round of the presidential elections if they were held tomorrow .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The question is , of course , did Popov bargain on all the publicity that his bank would be getting once word gets out that he has been funding an anti-EU and anti-immigration political part in France? Well, it might be that he thought that some publicity for his bank might actually attract more clients and raise his bank's profile .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let's face it , if a party gets 25 percent in the national vote , like the National Front did in the European elections this year , it means that a lot of people see it as a better bet than the other parties , which in turn means that the potential client base is substantial .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Russia itself, the National Front is not seen as ""racist"" or ""fascist"", as some sections of the French media portray it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In doing so , they seem to forget that by labelling this party as racists and fascists , they also label 25 percent of the French electorate as racists and fascists .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Russia, the National Front is considered a right-wing political party that has some sensible policies on the EU, on immigration and supports the idea of a strong French identity and closer ties with Russia .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The opposition UMP - led once again by Sarkozy - incidentally, shares some of the National Front's views on immigration and the EU .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Leading Russian political expert Andrey Fursov says that ""to call the National Front [headed by Marine Le Pen] a far-right or fascist party is an exaggeration and a mistake"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""It's a right-wing party, yes,"" he says .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""In our modern times, it's the left- wing socialists who can actually be called fascists.""  In his opinion, those who are called right-wing these days are ""realists"" who don't want Europe to be enslaved by the US and the ""Euro-bureaucracy"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In 1783, Russia and the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti , which would later become part of modern day Republic of Georgia , signed the Treaty of Georgievsk .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Among other things this treaty gave Kartli-Kakheti a status of a Russian protectorate .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Squished between the Russian, Persian, and Ottoman Empires , this was exactly what the tiny kingdom needed ... or so they thought .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The deal with Russia soon turned deadly .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia reneged on the treaty, and by 1795 Russian troops had left the region and a Persian army had invaded and leveled the capital city of Tbilisi .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Georgians have never forgotten this betrayal .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When Soviet Russia marked the bicentenary of the Treaty of Georgievsk in 1983 it was met with mass protests from anti-Soviet Georgians .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Treaty of Georgievsk might have been the first dodgy treaty Russia signed in the region but it certainly has not been the last .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Soon Russia is expected to sign a treaty with Georgia's breakaway province South Ossetia .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last November, Russia and Abkhazia - another breakaway province in Georgia - signed a treaty on ""alliance and strategic partnership"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This treaty established a coordinated foreign policy, the creation of a ""common security and defense space"" between Russia and Abkhazia, and the implementation of a streamlined process for Abkhazians to receive Russian citizenship .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The pending treaty with South Ossetia is expected to bring the relationship between South Ossetia and Russia even closer .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While Abkhaz officials have shown little interest in getting annexed by Russia , many in South Ossetia would be happy with this outcome .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The defacto leader of South Ossetia Leonid Tibilov said the treaty could see the tiny breakaway province ""becoming a subject of the Russian Federation"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Ossetian people are representative of the typical geographical, religious, and ethnic complexities found in the Caucasus .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ethically and linguistically they are descended from Iranians .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Religiously they are Orthodox Christian .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Ossetian people are unique in the Caucasus as they are the only ethnic group found living in large numbers on both sides of the mountains .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even so ,  South Ossetia does not have close links to Russia's North Ossetia as one might expect .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only road linking the two Ossetias runs through the Roki tunnel which was only completed in 1984 .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  Tskhinvali, the administrative capital of South Ossetia, is closer to Tbilisi than it is to North Ossetia's capital city Vladikavkaz .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia, Russia has occupied South Ossetia with thousands of troops .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Almost seven years on, Russia is still in direct violation of the Six Point Ceasefire Agreement brokered by then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia has spent millions of dollars building a fence around the administrative boundary between South Ossetia and Georgia .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In some cases, the fence cuts homes, families, and properties into half .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia is one of only four countries that recognise South Ossetia's independence (the others being Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Nauru) .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By contrast, many European countries and the United States recognise the Russian presence in South Ossetia as an illegal occupation .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia needs to think carefully before annexing South Ossetia .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Moscow has experienced with Crimea , annexation comes at a cost, both economically and geo-politically .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Economic sanctions are starting to bite , the ruble is down , and the low price of oil is severely impacting the Russian economy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then there are all the other costs associated with annexation : paying for pensions, local services, healthcare, education, and infrastructure - this is a heavy burden for the stagnate Russian economy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Georgian Foreign Ministry criticised Russia's move as a step toward ""annexation of Georgia's occupied territories"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In reality ,  there is little Georgia can do about it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Raising international awareness and encouraging the US and Europe to link economic sanctions connected to Russia's annexation of Crimea to any possible annexation of South Ossetia is the first thing the Georgian government should do .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The history of the Caucasus has shown that allegiances have, and can , change over time .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Through a long term process of confidence building measures, the Georgian government needs to show those in South Ossetia that their future is brighter with Tbilisi and in the transatlantic community than it is with Russia .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally ,  Georgia must stick with its ""non-use of force"" pledge regarding the occupied territories .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is no military solution to either South Ossetia or Abkhazia , and the region can hardly afford another war .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is ironic that since the early 1990s thousands of South Ossetians have died fighting for their independence from Georgia when they are likely to hand over their sovereignty to Russia .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia's treaties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia should be seen for what they really are: the first step in a process of Russian annexation of both breakaway regions  - both of which are still internationally recognised to be part of Georgia .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But to think that these pressures will force the Kremlin into even partial submission and to change its posture on global issues and weaken its grip on its immediate neighbourhood would be to misjudge President Vladimir Putin .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It could have the exact opposite effect , as Russia's president perhaps walks his way out of this through consolidation at home and further assertiveness and intransigence abroad .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In his annual State of the Nation address to parliament on December 4, Putin evoked exactly that .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He called for the public's resilience in the face of hardship, and promised to continue his foreign policy in the belief in the justness of Russia's cause and greatness .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Second ,  Russia firmly believes that Americans are interventionists and falsely moralistic in their discourse .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are heavily involved in using soft power to manipulate and shape the will of the people while advocating the independence and sovereignty of states and respect of the will of those same people to determine their own future .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the same speech, Putin accused the West of meddling in Russia's internal affairs , claiming that sanctions were merely an excuse to weaken Russia .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov charged the West with seeking regime change in Moscow .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia has always blamed the West for its policies of interference in other countries' internal affairs, but had never before implied that it had worries of its own .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Facing a Cold War .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First there are the traditionalists of the 1960s who argued that the Cold War was the direct result of Stalin's aggressive Soviet expansionism .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Later on, particularly during the Vietnam War, the revisionists (William Appleman Williams) challenged that view blaming the US for the Cold War , arguing that : ""America's chief aim in the years after the war was to make sure that there was an 'open door' for American trade , and that this led the American government to try to make sure that countries remained capitalist like the United States.""  Then there were the post-revisionists (John Lewis Gaddis) in the 1970s who believed that : ""America and Russia wanted to keep the peace after the war but that conflict was caused by mutual misunderstanding, reactivity, and above all the American inability to understand Stalin's fears and need to defend himself after the war.""  The latter is the closest guide to today's problems .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the specificities of the current period is that the West considers Russia to be both part of the solution but part of the problem as well .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  Russia supports the separatists in Ukraine and is the only power that can influence decisions there and make the rebels listen .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contentious issue .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The reopening of embassies in Baghdad after the US-led occupation had been a contentious issue for regional actors in the Middle East .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The new politicians in Iraq had to urge various Arab states and organisations to reopen their embassies in Baghdad in order to bestow some regional legitimacy upon a nascent Iraqi government .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Arab League hesitated reopening its diplomatic facilities in Baghdad as an indirect way of protesting the fact that an Arab capital was under foreign control .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Agency's written response to the report says ; ""We fully agree"" - the CIA had ""no cadre of trained and experienced interrogators, little experience handling and moving prisoners, and no core competency in prison management .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[...] The Agency had too few analysts and linguists with the expertise required to support [a detention] programme"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In other words ,  there is no dispute that the programme was started and run on the fly .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A critical finding of the Senate report was that torturing detainees did not yield otherwise unobtainable actionable intelligence .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CIA director, John O Brennan, admitted that the agency ""has not concluded that it was the use of EITs that allowed us to obtain useful information from detainees"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So while the CIA still maintains that it gained valuable intelligence from detainees , it is not saying the abusive methods produced it .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Senate report also describes how the CIA sought out two psychiatrists, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen , to construct the torture programme instead of actual experienced interrogators , on the assumption that long-established humane and lawful interrogation methods wouldn't work .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In its response, the CIA acknowledged that it had to look beyond the agency to find experts on ""non-standard means of interrogation"" since it was not an area of expertise that CIA officers or the US government possessed .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The CIA called Mitchell and Jessen's background ""so unique"" that the agency ""would have been derelict had [it] not sought them out when it became clear that CIA would be heading into the uncharted territory of the programme"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In other words ,  the torture programme was so out of whack with what professional interrogators do that the CIA had to go outside the US government to find people to do it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There still are important areas of disagreement between the Senate report and the CIA .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The CIA is too protective of its own to acknowledge the full import of its descent into torture or to disavow the programme entirely .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the agency - unlike its loudest defenders - is not endorsing torture as a means of gaining intelligence or keeping the country safe .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To be sure , basing the case against torture on its total ineffectiveness is a risky proposition .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Torture produces a lot of information and while victims frequently make things up to ease their suffering , they may also on occasion say things of some value .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's why it is important to remember that torture is illegal under any circumstances regardless of its utility .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But in a democracy, the strength of legal norms depends partly on their acceptance by the public .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So while the public shouldn't have to be persuaded that barbaric methods fail to make them safer , doing so reinforces their illegality .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The flurry of media appearances by Cheney and other torture defenders has created a false sense that there is a genuine divide over whether torture ""works"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But neither the CIA nor professional interrogators actually say that .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The case of Abu Zubaydah has long been known .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amnesty International first raised its concerns with the US government in April 2002 .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was the first person to be taken into CIA custody considered by the agency to have high intelligence value .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abu Zubaydah was effectively treated as a human guinea pig to test the CIA's emerging interrogation regime .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He was subjected to a range of torture methods, including being waterboarded multiple times .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The SSCI summary adds some new chilling details .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A July 15, 2002 cable sent by the interrogation team at ""Detention Site Green"", believed to be in Thailand , ended : ""In light of the planned psychological pressure techniques to be implemented , we need to get reasonable assurances that [Abu Zubaydah] will remain in isolation and incommunicado for the remainder of his life."" CIA officers responded that ""all major players are in concurrence that [Abu Zubaydah] should remain incommunicado for the rest of his life"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then , after Abu Zubaydah had been subjected to 47 days of complete isolation , he was subjected to numerous ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" including physical assaults, stress positions, cramped confinement, white noise, and sleep deprivation ""in varying combinations, 24 hours a day for 17 straight days"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reports were constantly fed back to top authorities .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daily cables sent from ""Detention Site Green"" to CIA headquarters recorded that Abu Zubaydah frequently ""cried"", ""begged"", ""pleaded"", and ""whimpered"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At times, he was ""hysterical"" and ""distressed to the level that he was unable to effectively communicate"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Waterboarding sessions would result in ""hysterical pleas"" , and on at least one occasion, Abu Zubaydah ""became completely unresponsive"" until he received medical attention .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abu Zubaydah's ordeal is not yet over .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After four and a half years in secret CIA custody he was transferred to Guantanamo , where he remains today .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He has never been charged with any crime .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The injustice continues .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On August 5, 2002, at the same time that Abu Zubaydah was being tortured in Thailand , CIA headquarters approved an interrogation plan for Ridha al-Najjar at another secret facility, dubbed ""Detention Site Cobalt"" , believed to be the Salt Pit facility in Afghanistan .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The interrogation plan for Najjar included isolation in total darkness , lowering the quality of his food, keeping him in cold temperatures, 24-hour-a-day loud music, shackling and hooding .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over one two-day period, he was left with his wrists handcuffed to an overhead bar for 22 hours a day in order to ""break his resistance"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On September 21, 2002, his interrogators sent a cable describing Najjar as ""clearly a broken man"" and ""on the verge of complete breakdown"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His detention and interrogation ""became the model"" for the treatment of detainees at that facility, according to the SSCI .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Twelve years later, Najjar remains in US custody in Bagram, Afghanistan .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He has never been charged or tried, and is still being denied his right to challenge his detention in court .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A petition on his behalf is currently pending before the US Supreme Court .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The psychological impact of such intense cruelty has devastated those subjected to it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to the SSCI, many detainees ""exhibited psychological and behavioural issues, including hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, and attempts at self-harm and self-mutilation"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Majid Khan , who was held in secret CIA custody for three and a half years before being transferred in 2006 to Guantanamo , where he remains today , is said to have engaged in numerous acts of self-harm , including ""attempting to cut his wrist on two occasions , to chew into his arm at the inner elbow , cut a vein in the top of his foot and into his skin at the elbow joint using a filed toothbrush"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the world struggles to comprehend the details in the summary it is important to remember all we've been given is a snapshot, a peek through the keyhole to the dark secrets hidden within .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That report describes the detention and interrogation of 119 detainees held by the CIA .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Senator Dianne Feinstein said that ""decisions will be made at a later date"" as to whether the whole report will be declassified and released .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amnesty International believes this should be done sooner rather than later ,  indeed should be set in motion now .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Senate committee also needs to address the fact that the US human rights violations and crimes went beyond torture .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The CIA detainees were subjected to enforced disappearance  - which, like torture, is a crime under international law .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No one has been brought to justice for these crimes .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This accountability gap leaves the US squarely on the wrong side of its international obligations .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Those responsible, no matter their current or previous level of office, must be brought to justice, along with those in other countries that colluded with the CIA to facilitate these programmes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
December 10 marked 30 years since the adoption of the Convention Against Torture - an anniversary which the US would do well not to gloss over .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The US ratified the treaty in 1994 .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Obama should make a public commitment to end the impunity being enjoyed by those who authorised and carried out the crimes committed in the CIA programmes of rendition, interrogation and detention .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"On December 9, the Senate Select Committee released a partial report of the horrifying, illegal torture tactics used by the CIA during the Bush administration .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some question the timing .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think the timing is perfect .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We are now in a position to recall what past black activists, from Martin Luther King to Angela Davis to Muhammad Ali, knew when they spoke against the immoral actions of their nation in Vietnam .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The protesters in Ferguson got a sneak peek, or a reminder, of this lesson in August , when Palestinians , who had experience with being shot at with US-made weaponry , advised US protesters on how to treat the searing pain of tear gas bombs (pour Coca-Cola directly over the eyes) .",no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But recently, because of the quick succession of the failures to indict the killers of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, and then the release of the torture report , we are at a moment in which the link between our domestic terrorism and our international terrorism is being drawn for the rest of us .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Immediately after the release of the report, many in the media did their best to claim that the release of this report was part of some wider conspiracy to demoralise Americans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The best example of this would be Fox News' Andrea Tantaros , who, in the middle of a conversation about the report, began shouting that ""The United States of America is awesome , we are awesome."" She seemed positively indignant that the Obama administration was attempting to ""have this discussion to show us how we're not awesome"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For those unfamiliar with the slang of US hipsters and teenagers, we generally use the ""awesome/not awesome"" binary to evaluate things like pizza, beer, or surfboards - not the moral character of a nation-state .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But , if we are to adopt her method of expression , Tantaros seems to be forgetting that she is able to be on television in part because one or two generations ago, a few people declared that women not being able to participate in news media was not very ""awesome"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She also forgets that a couple generations before that, her Greek last name would have prevented her from being considered ""white"" , and she thus would not have been allowed in front of a camera .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whether Tantaros accepts it or not , the history of equality in the US has been one of people deciding that things were not yet awesome , and taking it upon themselves to make them more awesome .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But we should note that Tantaros was primarily angry at being forced to have a public conversation , and at being embarrassed that the world was seeing us have a discussion about our behaviour .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""This makes us look bad,"" she pleaded .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""And all this does is have our enemies laughing at us.""  Not only is torture illegal , but by US' own standards, it is ineffective .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The CIA knew this .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The 1992 US Army Field Manual on Interrogation explicitly advises that ""the use of force is a poor technique , as it yields unreliable results"", and can ""induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This ended up being true - we now know that one prisoner told the CIA that he was trying to recruit black Muslims in the US to attack gas stations .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He later admitted that he made up the story , ""because he thought that's what interrogators wanted to hear"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This year has also shown us that ineptitude can also happen at home, with our domestic police forces .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Ferguson Police Department has utterly failed to de-escalate tensions at every possible opportunity .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We now know the officer that killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice was not fit to hold a pistol, much less a badge .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  a report by the Justice Department has shown that Cleveland police officers routinely use unjustified force in arrests, and fire their weapons ""carelessly"" , putting both innocent bystanders and themselves in danger .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If the timing of the one-two punch of public revelations of anti-black racism and criminal torture do not convince us , then we can at least recognise a pattern in the people that are desperate to deny both .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The torture report is available to anyone to view online , provided they are willing to wade through pages and pages of gruesome accounts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is an account of putting a prisoner in a diaper, shackling him to the ceiling, and leaving him for days .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One prisoner died of hypothermia after being chained, nearly naked, to a concrete floor .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many were sexually assaulted .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite this, Republican Congressman Peter King attempted to wave these facts away , declaring that no harmful torture occurred .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead ,  he brushed it off as merely a few ""people made to stand in awkward positions"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is the same Peter King who said that Eric Garner did not die because of a chokehold , but because he was overweight .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is also the same Peter King that implied that Garner, in his final moments, was lying about not being able to breathe .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If Tantaros' reaction to the defiling of the ""awesomeness"" of the US seems childish , Peter King's reaction is worse .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is the rhetorical equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears, and shouting ""nyah, nyah , I can't hear you"" - as your brother drowns beside you .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And , as if we needed any clearer indication on how racism and callousness regarding the torture of non-whites were connected , we were given a clear reminder last week , when Facebook released a 23 second commercial about a feature of its service, and cast a Sikh man as the spokesperson .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The video was immediately bombarded with angry comments calling the man an ""ISIL terrorist"", a ""raghead"", and a ""sand nigger"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One commenter blasted Facebook itself , asking ""Why do you have a Muslim on this pic?"" When another user replied that he was a Sikh , the commenter responded : ""Same thing.""  We might chalk this up to ignorance : Our education system is focused on white European and US history .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most Americans don't know the difference between a friendly Sikh man and a scary Muslim terrorist .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Actually, most Americans couldn't tell you the difference between a fatwah and a plate of chapati .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But we should be more precise here - it's not that we don't know , it's that we don't want to know .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But then again , separating ""good"" brown people from ""bad"" ones isn't the point, and wouldn't make a difference .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For too many of us, anyone brown and bearded is automatically al-Qaeda, and deserves to be tortured and killed .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our understanding of humanity does not apply to anyone that can be mistaken for Muslim or Arab , and we excuse ourselves for this moral exception by constantly reminding ourselves that our country was attacked in 2001 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Over the years, Kenyan police have acquired a dubious reputation of being a source of insecurity instead of one of security .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In many instances, the police represent clear, palpable and imminent danger to the lives of Kenyan citizens .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The transformation of the police from a security institution into a bastion of insecurity didn't occur overnight , nor did it come as a surprise ; it was the inevitable outcome of a number of factors .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of these factors are beyond their control .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For instance ,  policemen are underpaid and ill-equipped to do their job ; others seem to be an institutional choice, such as the endemic corruption within the police force .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Under the previous constitution, the police were at the beck and call of the executive , which used it as a tool of coercion to further its political goals .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result , when confronted by a new security situation , the executive's default response has been to set up a ""special"" police unit to address the situation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In most cases, t he unit would operate under minimum oversight and maximum impunity .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More than any other institution in the country, the police has deep institutional problems , but one of the most detrimental ones is its involvement in extrajudicial killings . Remarkably, this is not only a new phenomenon , but it is deeply entrenched with a clear pattern .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the 1990s, crime was on the rise in Kenya .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to stem the high rates of carjacking and violent robberies , in 1995 the government formed a new police unit called the Flying Squad . This special unit was given the express authority to shoot any suspect on sight without due process .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result, the unit was implicated in multiple and egregious extrajudicial killings , which they claimed was their way of dealing with the new security reality .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In some cases, the police officers were caught shooting suspects after they had surrendered or were lying face down .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The unit executed several innocent people in cold blood .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The police command instead of seeing the unit's trigger-happy attitude as dangerous , celebrated it as the only ""medicine"" with which to treat spiralling crime .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The late 1980s and 1990s saw deep economic problems , shrinking political space for dissent and increasing insecurity .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was the time when criminal gangs emerged and flourished .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These gangs e stablished their ""spheres of influence"" , mostly in slum areas , where the state's presence was negligible .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To establish loyalty from the community and enhance their legitimacy , these groups provided security for a token fee .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To exert their superiority, from time to time , these groups engaged each other over ""territories"" and business interests .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Among these groups were the Mungiki, the Taliban, the Kosovo boys, the Baghdad boys, Chinkororo, and the Kalenjin Warriors .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mungiki is a Kikuyu word for multitude .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The organisation had both a cultural and political element to it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the beginning of the group's existence , the social aspect was more prominent and it involved traditional Kikuyu beliefs in the god named Ngai . But as the organisation expanded , it began taking an overtly political posture , which brought them into confrontation with the state .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mungiki operated primarily in the Nairobi slums, in the Central Province and parts of the Rift Valley .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In these areas, the group started providing the poor in slum areas with protection and social services for a fee .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Refusal to pay the protection "" tax "" almost always resulted in violence and killings .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2002, the Kenyan government banned 18 of these criminal gangs .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The spread of Mungiki's influence forced the government in 2007 to establish a special police unit called Kwekwe which was tasked primarily with hunting down members of Mungiki .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But Kwekwe's operation against the criminal group went too far .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to a National Commission on Human Rights 2008 report : ""Extrajudicial executions and other brutal acts of extreme cruelty have been perpetrated by the police against so-called Mungiki adherents and that these acts may have been committed pursuant to official policy sanctioned by the political leadership, the police commissioner and top police commander"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"HRW observed in 2008 that , ""The brutality of the police crackdown matched or even exceeded that of the Mungiki itself.""  Kenya has been in the crosshairs of the transnational jihadi movement .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the past, the fact that Kenya was seen as being firmly in the western sphere of influence made Kenya a target , with most of the incidents, including the 1998 US embassy attack, targeting western interests .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  after Kenya's intervention in Somalia in 2011, the country itself become a target .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terrorism activity in Kenya reached a peak with the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in September 2013 , when unidentified gunmen killed 67 people and injured almost 200 others .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a response to the growing terrorism threat, the Kenyan government created the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) in March 2003, following the 2002 attack on an Israeli-owned Mombasa hotel .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was also accompanied by the passage of Anti-Terrorism Act in 2012 .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As part of the wider counterterrorism effort, the government also began a huge crackdo wn on the Somali and Muslim communities especially in Nairobi, parts of Northern Kenya and coastal Kenya .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the crackdown intensified , a number of extrajudicial killings of Muslim preachers took place, some in the coastal city of Mombasa .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of the victims were suspected of having connections with Somalia's al-Shabab group .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While in almost all the cases the police deny culpability , research by human rights organisations reveals the ATPU's involvement .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In its August 2014 report , ""Kenya: Killings, disappearance by anti-terror police,"" HRW points to "" ...evidence of at least 10 cases of extrajudicial killings of terrorism suspects , some of whom were last seen in ATPU custody or had been threatened by the unit's officers after courts had released them"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Kenyan government has accused some of the clerics who were killed of recruiting Muslim youth for terrorism activities through their mosques .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  despite initiating investigations against them , the government never followed through to prosecute the imams .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After public outcry over the killing of Muslim cleric Ibrahim ""Rogo"" Omar, the government set up a task force to investigate his murder .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The director of public prosecution promised in 2013 that he will institute an inquest, but has not done so yet .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One of the commissions established following the 2007-2008 violence to look at the role of the police , was the Waki Commission .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Established to look into the circumstances and facts surrounding the violence and provide recommendations , the Waki Commission found that of the 1,500 deaths, the police was responsible for more than 30 percent of them .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result several reform measures were proposed including the establishment of a civilian oversight of the police, and many other reforms .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  due to lack of political will, the police reforms have stalled .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The extrajudicial killings by the police in Kenya are anchored in a systemic lack of accountability and deeply entrenched culture of pervasive impunity .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It was reported in The Guardian last week that Emergency, an Italian NGO, administered an untested heart drug known as Amiodarone, to patients at an Ebola treatment centre in Lakka, Sierra Leone .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The British medics sent to work at the centre raised alarm as early as November about Emergency's approaches to palliative care .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amiodarone, a drug licenced to regulate the heartbeat , has never been tested outside of a lab setting to treat humans or animals infected with Ebola .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was neither approved by the Sierra Leonean health ministry nor listed among the 53 drugs that have an antiviral effect on Ebola .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a report to UK Med, the British healthcare professionals argued that ""the toxic side effects of Amiodarone could in fact be contributing to increased morbidity within the ETC [ebola treatment centre]"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While the mortality rate at Emergency's centre is disputed - ranging from 58 and 67 percent - the death rate at centres run by Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), for instance, ranges from 50 and 60 percent .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most alarming is the concern that foreign-run Ebola treatment centres could be using unorthodox testing methods with impunity .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Emergency's use of Amiodarone without a proper clinical trial or patient consent prompted censure from a senior scientist about the recklessness of this approach and a walk-out over safety fears by the UK health workers sent to work at the treatment centre .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Apparently, the NGO stopped using the drug after receiving a request from the Department of International Development (DFID) , which had been alerted by the British medics .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When rumours circulated early-on during the Ebola outbreak , that the virus was a form of bio warfare , critics were quick to label these ideas ""conspiracy theories"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"As unconscionable as Emergency's practices appear , there is a long history of unethical drug testing on poor and vulnerable communities across the globe .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps one of the most famous cases of unethical experimental treatment was in 1932 when Public Health Service in the United States began the ""Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male"" at a time when there was no known cure for syphilis .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The study initially included 600 black men - 399 with and 201 without syphilis  - most of whom were poor and illiterate sharecroppers enticed with incentives such as free medical exams, meals on examination days, and promises that their relatives would receive burial stipends in the event of their deaths .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The men were deceived into thinking that they were being treated for ""bad blood"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They neither received proper treatment nor were they informed of the true nature of the study .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead of lasting for six months , as originally projected , the study went on for 40 years .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When penicillin was developed to treat syphilis in 1947 , treatment was withheld from all 600 subjects .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1973, a class action suit was filed on behalf of the men in the study and settled out of court for $9 million .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similar experiments were held in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948 , when Public Health Service infected 1,610 total soldiers, female commercial sex workers, prisoners and mental health patients with one of three sexually transmitted diseases - syphilis, gonorrhoea, or chancroid .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like the Tuskegee experiment, none of the human subjects were informed about the nature of the study , nor did they give consent .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unlike the Tuskegee study, however, patients in Guatemala were eventually inoculated with penicillin though it is unclear how many were actually cured .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although vulnerable adult populations have borne the brunt of unethical medical testing , children have not been spared .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the mid-nineties, the world's largest research-based drug company, Pfizer, administered the experimental drug, Trovan, during a meningitis outbreak in Kano in northern Nigeria .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The parents of eleven children who died sued Pfizer , alleging that Trovan was used without their informed consent .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pfizer eventually settled out of court in 2009 , promising to pay the Kano state government $75 million .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For too long, the bodies of poor and vulnerable communities have been exploited to serve the medical fetishes of big pharmaceutical companies, research institutions and Western governments .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  there is a growing tide against this warped practice .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In his 2014 Reith lecture series entitled 'The Future of Medicine', renowned surgeon, writer and public health researcher Dr Atul Gawande argued convincingly that the well- being of a patient is more important than his/her ""health"" .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore ,  the goal of medical practice should be ""caring"" , and not simply ""curing"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the age of Ebola, it appears that the single-minded pursuit to ""cure"" has somehow superseded the Hippocratic Oath to which doctors must adhere to ""do no harm"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I still can't erase the verses from my mind: ""Oh Great Ataturk , who had created our life of today ; on the path that you have paved, in the country that you established , I swear to walk incessantly with the purposes that you have set.""  Every Turkish citizen had to put their hearts and souls into that oath .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The louder you spoke those words , the better a citizen you were .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Those days are not yet ancient history .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) only abolished this fascist practice in 2013 .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Pro-Kemalist media attacked the reform package, including many democratic regulations , while their columnists harshly criticised the move because Turkey was leaving behind its worship of Ataturk .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Red lines .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the days following the global outrage over the attack on the French satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, many in Turkey seem to have forgotten those days when any criticism of Ataturk was a punishable offence - one that could label you a traitor .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kemalism is not only an ideology ; for many Turks, it was akin to religion .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poems depicting Ataturk as a God are evidence of an attempt to impose Kemalism as a religion .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's why Islam, the religion of the majority of Turkish society, was seen as a threat for them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was not enough that Ataturk was beloved by his supporters .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Roland Barthes' famous words would describe what we lived then : ""Fascism is not the prohibition of saying things ; it is the obligation to say them.""  Cumhuriyet, a leading daily newspaper of the old guard founded in 1924, has always been a symbol of Kemalism since the beginning .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Turkish public were accustomed to their publications attacking Muslims, seeing them as a threat, despising them, or their columnists' pieces insulting Islam .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the other hand ,  they have always had clear red lines when it came to Kemalism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cumhuriyet has never given a place to a critique of Ataturk or Kemalism ; on the contrary ,  it has attacked the critics .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last week, Cumhuriyet announced that it would publish the Charlie Hebdo cartoons in order to defend freedom expression .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In so doing , they attracted a lot of reaction .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A look at history shows why .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The US has been attacked on domestic territory twice in the past century .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan bombed Pearl Harbour , killing 2,403 Americans and wounding 1,178 others .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The next day, US Congress voted to declare war on Japan , thus committing to active hostilities in World War II .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That declaration of war has since proved to be the last in the history of the US .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The next and last mass scale violent attack by an outside aggressor on the domestic territory of the US occurred 13 years ago, on September 11, 2001, with the immediate death toll approaching 3,000 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Three days later, Congress adopted an Authorisation for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against those held responsible for the September 11 attacks .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In so doing , Congress delegated war-making powers to President George W Bush under the terms of the War Powers Act of 1973 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
December 7 and September 11 are notable in part because in both cases horrendous violence against the people of the US was responded to with an act of Congress .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oppose or support US entry into either of those wars, question or affirm that those wars were lawful , there was no question in either case that Congress had signed off on them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Congressional approval .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It mattered that Congress approve , because Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution accords primary war powers, including the power to commence and end war , to Congress alone .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For a president of the US to make war without congressional approval was an unthinkable act that would have threatened the legitimacy of the federal government .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With his war on the so-called Islamic State , US President Barack Obama has committed that unthinkable act , and Congress has let him .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And yet ,  by all appearances, no one outside of a handful of members of Congress, legal scholars, and peace activists has spoken out in protest .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contrast this moment with that of the weeks and months following September 11 .,other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On September 29, 2001, upwards of 25,000 people marched through Washington, DC, against the impending invasion of Afghanistan ; tens of thousands demonstrated elsewhere throughout the US .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By April 20, 2002, the anti-war protest in Washington drew over 150,000 .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By February 15, national protest turnout hit 2 million .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given this history, one cannot conclude that the size and volume of anti-war protests directly resulted from the relative popularity of a particular war .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After all ,  the 2001-2003 protests erupted and swelled over a period in which polls showed continued strong support among the US public for Washington's war operations .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And in fact, as in 2003-2008 public opinion turned against the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the size and volume of anti-war movement went down .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The simple and correct explanation for this history is that anti-war organisers made decisions in 2001, 2002, and 2003 , to focus their energies on mobilising street protests , and that in the years 2004-2008 , as anti-war sentiment was taken up by a majority of the American people , many anti-war organisers shifted much of their focus to electing anti-war candidates to office .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What has changed since Obama assumed the presidency? In Washington, in terms of war and security, very little .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Every day I receive notices about civil disobedience at military bases, hunger strikes, local government resolutions calling for a shift in spending priorities away from the military, and much more .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For this reason ,  the relative silence of anti-war organisers in the face of the war against the so-called Islamic State stands out as a warning to the Washington establishment; those who oppose their policies question whether Congress and the presidency can provide effective redress for the grievances of the American people .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This, in turn, provides the proper context for scenes of militant African resistance .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Particularly illustrative of the prevailing ""order of the world"" is an interview with a white settler in then-Rhodesia who addresses his black servant boy as ""you stupid thing, you"" and laments the impending African reclamation of the territory : ""The gooks have got it.""  When asked by the interviewer to clarify his derogatory slang , he elaborates with more slang: ""The terrs ... The whole world is supporting the terrorists.""  To be sure , we've superficially done away with the whole colonialism business, it being generally understood that colonies are bad and archaic things .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are, however, notable exceptions to the rule, as in the case of state of Israel , which is granted a de facto exemption from ceasing colonial operations and is furthermore regularly lauded as a beacon of democracy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the same oppressive structures that underpinned colonialism continue to flourish in the age of neoliberal globalisation , which functions according to the idea that there is a class of human beings - often but not always determined by skin colour - entitled to a level of wealth and comfort that is only attainable by depriving the global masses of a dignified existence .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poor Africans might be forgiven for failing to detect enormous differences between this and previous intrusions from abroad .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In other parts of the world that the US prefers to think of as its own personal military base - such as Central America - the imperial power has backed the security forces of various repressive and illegitimate leaders committed to violently squelching popular protest .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reasons for protest have included government insistence on catering to foreign corporations rather than to indigenous and peasant communities opposed to the usurpation and contamination of their lands by mining operations and the like .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the victims are largely invisible, the dehumanised refuse of empire and the price to be paid for securing corporate profit .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In her spoken preface to Concerning Violence, renowned Columbia University professor Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak explains that in ""reading between the lines"" of The Wretched of the Earth, one sees that Fanon does not in fact endorse violence but rather ""insists that the tragedy is that the very poor is reduced to violence , because there is no other response possible to an absolute absence of response and an absolute exercise of legitimised violence from the colonisers"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spivak goes on to make a telling comparison regarding the earth's ""wretched"" : ""Their lives count as nothing against the death of the colonisers: unacknowledged Hiroshimas against sentimentalised 9/11s.""  For another modern-day example of legitimised violence and self-victimisation by the very purveyors of said violence, it seems appropriate to once again bring up the state of Israel , which shares the ex-Rhodesian resident's knack for hallucinating himself into a position of unparalleled suffering at the hands of ""terrorists"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Meanwhile , Israel's primary benefactor - the nation described by Fanon as the ""former European colony [that] decided to catch up with Europe"" - should find much to reflect on in Concerning Violence , particularly given Fanon's conclusion regarding the European experiment : ""It succeeded so well that the United States of America became a monster , in which the taints, the sickness, and the inhumanity of Europe have grown to appalling dimensions.""  Contemporary manifestations of the American sickness include the recent decision by a Missouri grand jury not to indict a police officer for killing an unarmed black teenager in the city of Ferguson - far from an isolated instance of fatal bigotry .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Drawing on several of Fanon's texts , journalist Roqayah Chamseddine penned an essay on the aftermath of the Ferguson decision for Al-Akhbar English , in which she condemned the liberal American tradition of placing the onus of non- violence on those oppressed by the state rather than the state itself - an entity that engages in ""unfettered police brutality and judicial discrimination"" against black communities .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent targeting .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is not the first time the RFE/RL station, locally called Azadliq Radio (Liberty Radio) is targeted by the authorities .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2009, its FM broadcast was shut down .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BBC radio service and Voice of America followed suit .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For years, the police harassed the radio's reporters , often confiscating or breaking their equipment or detaining them for endless hours of interrogation .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On December 5, Azadliq Radio investigative journalist and the host of the radio's daily show, Khadija Ismayilova, was arrested and placed in pre-trial detention for two months .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Accused of ""incitement to suicide"" or ""an attempt to suicide"" as per Article 125 of the Criminal Code, Ismayilova remains in jail  - even though her accuser, Tural Mustafayev, has withdrawn his complaint .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mustafayev had accused Ismayilova of inciting him to attempt suicide and ""insulting his honour and dignity on social networks and among her friends following the break-up of their relations and his intention to marry another woman"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On December 30, the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed Ismayilova's appeal for house arrest .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prior to this charge, Ismayilova was already facing an unrelated criminal trial for defamation linked to her posting a document on Facebook revealing the identity of a man who was an informant for Azerbaijan's intelligence services .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In October , when travelling for a conference in Prague , Ismayilova was prevented from leaving the country .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A little over a week before this trip, Ismayilova was searched and detained for four hours at Baku International Airport .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She was returning from Strasbourg where she talked about the deteriorating human rights conditions in Azerbaijan .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Her investigative work uncovered many of the hidden and illegal business dealings of the ruling Aliyev family and other government officials for which she is recognised internationally .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ismayilova is the recipient of Global Shining Award, the Gerd Bucerius Free Press of Eastern Europe Award, the Courage of Journalism Award, and named one of the Brave Thinkers of the world by Atlantic magazine .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Was it a coincidence that Ismayilova's detention came just a day after the country's chief of staff, Ramiz Mehdiyev, accused Ismayilova of treason and being a foreign spy? Or that the radio station was raided and then closed in another few weeks time?  In his 60-page diatribe on ""Western Colonialism"", Mehdiyev wrote : ""Their main concern is lip service to their bosses abroad and keeping good relations with them .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The example is Azadliq Radio's journalist Kahdija Ismayilova .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Together with her colleague 'friends' she puts on anti-Azerbaijani shows, makes absurd statements, openly demonstrates destructive attitude towards well-known members of the Azerbaijani community, and spreads insulting lies .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is clear this sort of defiance pleases Ms Ismayilova's patrons abroad.""  He concluded : ""Overall there is an understanding within the society that Azadliq Radio and its employees are on a disgusting path .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no need to prove that provision of false information is the same as working for the foreign secret service .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is treason .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is what journalists and people with a healthy mindset would think .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If the symbol of democracy is Khadija Ismayilova , then it is awful to imagine what future awaits the society.""  Siyavush Novruzov, an MP from the ruling party, agrees .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In an interview with a local news site, Novruzov said : ""Every place that works for foreign intelligence and the Armenian lobby should be searched.""  The Armenian lobby is just another popular tool used by government circles to punish dissent in Azerbaijan .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite its support for Track Two diplomacy initiatives, Aliyev's regime was quick to accuse Leyla Yunus and Rauf Mirkadirov of treason and spying for Armenia this year .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both Yunus and Mirkadirov have been engaged in public diplomacy initiatives pressing for reconciliation between Armenia and Azerbaijan for over a decade .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The authorities were fully aware of their work for years .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And yet ,  in what has been by far the most unprecedented year of crackdowns , Azerbaijan continues to maintain a steady relationship with Europe and the image of a transforming country, young and rich, and eager to spend so long as its critics keep quiet .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With many of the country's prominent advocates, lawyers, and journalists in jail; independent media platforms under attack; and only a handful of international non-governmental organisations left in the country, there is little hope for the country's positive transformation anytime soon .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Afghan women have come a long way since the dark days of the Taliban regime .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet a key obstacle to this progress continues to be high levels of violence against women .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The legal system has failed to protect women adequately when it comes to some of the most common crimes against them; rape, domestic violence, underage and forced marriages .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That is why , in 2009, a number of prominent Afghan women's rights activists, members of civil society groups , and some lawmakers came together to draft a bill to better protect women through legal channels and to define crimes of violence against women .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The bill, known as The Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) Law, was decreed into law through an Executive Order by the former Afghan President Hamid Karzaion, on July 20, 2009 , while parliament was in recess .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During such periods, the Afghan Constitution allows the president to issue decrees for emergency purposes , but the Constitution also requires such decrees to be forwarded to parliament for approval .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some women activists nonetheless suggested that it was not necessary to send the EVAW law to parliament .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Political climate .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Others, including myself, argued that although the Executive Order on EVAW was a significant step in the battle for the elimination of violence against women , the law remained vulnerable to being reversed by a new president .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  presidential elections were just around the corner .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the drawdown of the international troops drew nearer , we feared that the political climate would make it increasingly difficult to get the law anchored in parliament .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition ,  we feared that any peace talks with the Taliban could end up sacrificing EVAW in a bid to appease the militants .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Securing parliamentary approval for the law would give us much stronger ammunition in protecting it against extremist attacks .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to get an agreement on the EVAW law in parliament , we worked tirelessly for months , using three main strategies .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, we started a lobbying campaign with those who opposed the law, mainly conservatives .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondly, we went to visit them in their houses , explaining the law to them article by article to obtain their signature in support of the law .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also organised exchange visits for conservative MPs to other Muslim countries so they could explore how these countries had been enforcing similar legislation for decades .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally we worked through the joint committee in parliament for more than two years to develop a consensus on the law and defuse the opposition of conservatives .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In late 2009, there were only two issues left where conservative MPs did not agree .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These were the law's punishment of relatives for underage marriage and for polygamy under certain conditions as well as the fact that women's rights advocates wanted to include ""honour killings"" as a specific crime in the law .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At this point , however ,  MPs became increasingly preoccupied with the then- upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for Spring 2010 , thus the process lost momentum .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unfortunately, after the 2010 parliamentary elections, we ended up with a more conservative parliament .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contested election results left the new parliament paralysed for almost a year .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a consequence, discussions about the EVAW law only resumed in mid-2011 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At this time the draft was re-sent to the 18 parliamentary commissions .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All but one of the commissions agreed with the text of the law or presented constructive suggestions .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The final commission, the legislative (Taqnin) committee, headed by the foremost opponent of the EVAW law, submitted 34 pages of suggested amendments .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some of these suggestions were helpful and were duly included, such as a proposal to have specialised prosecution units in all of Afghanistan .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As before, we rejected the proposals to leave underage marriage and the contraction of invalid polygamous marriages as non-punishable acts .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We similarly rejected a new suggestion which was to close all women's shelters and arrange for the victims of violence to stay with relatives instead .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although the opponents were vocal , they did not outnumber the rest .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What was damaging , however ,  was an unhealthy political rivalry that ensued among mostly female parliamentarians and supporters of EVAW .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some progressive women's rights activists, including some from international organisations, argued that the time was not right to pass the EVAW and that it should be left as a presidential decree .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were good reasons for seeking parliamentary approval .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet some of my colleagues began accusing me of using the bill to further my own political career and gain support for my assumed ambitions for the 2014 presidential elections .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead of supporting EVAW , many female MPs stood silent during the parliamentary debates on the bill and some even went as far as to lobby against it .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result , when the law was presented to the plenary in May 2013 , conservative MPs who were opposed to EVAW were further emboldened .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The new Speaker of the House did not hold a lot a lot of influence and probably, for that reason, did not back the bill either .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the conservative MPs entrenched in their opposition to EVAW, a weak speaker and a lack of support from my fellow female MPs, the EVAW bill failed to pass .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Those of us who saw the passing of EVAW to be beyond politics , and understood its importance for tackling violence against women , were left heartbroken .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the international community now gradually disengaging from Afghanistan, time is running out for Afghan women .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We have made important gains since 2001 , but we need the force of the law behind us to sustain our achievements .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We need to arm ourselves with solid laws like the EVAW law to fight the violence and other ills of our society which are destroying the souls of our sisters across the country .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fact that the EVAW law has not been approved by the parliament is the reason for its weak implementation rates ; many justice officials are questioning the law's status and therefore do not apply it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One promising thing on the horizon is that we now have a president and chief executive who both understand the multitude of challenges facing women .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would like to take this opportunity and call on President Ashraf Ghani and our Chief Executive Dr Abdullah Abdullah to declare their support for the passage of the EVAW bill .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also call on my female colleagues in parliament and all Afghan women rights activists and our international partners to set aside their differences and join us in support of the ratification of the bill .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the recent parliamentary approval of the BSA shows , when the government and others make something a priority , the conservative MPs can be isolated .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Times may be difficult now for Afghanistan , differences may be wide and security challenges are growing , but failure to back the EVAW and allowing it to die will deal a severe blow to Afghan women's rights .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"To many people overseas, the United States government is viewed as an aggressive empire of military bases, drones, and special forces that transcend national borders .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But to big corporations, the US government is a patsy that gives away trillions of dollars of natural resources, tax revenues and public assets to grasping giant companies and industries .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The US has an unsurpassed record of transferring what belongs to all Americans to a few giant business interests .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unlike any other country, the federal government, under the 1872 Mining Act, gives away hard rock minerals (eg gold, silver, platinum, molybdenum) discovered on federal lands that belong to the American people, to the foreign or domestic companies that find these minerals .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1986, for example, a gold company found over $9bn worth of gold under federal land in Nevada .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The company bought rights to that gold for $5 per acre (less than $6,000 total) without having to pay any royalties on the mined gold back to the Department of Interior .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For over 100 years, valuable minerals worth hundreds of billions of dollars have been given away to the mining industry for $5 or less per acre .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Once these mines are exhausted , the law only requires companies to do little to clean up their toxic waters and waste .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As for other natural resources on federal land such as timber, grazing fields, oil, gas and coal, the companies pay very low fees to the government to obtain these valuable natural resources .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The public airwaves belong to the people .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  under a law passed in 1934 by the radio lobby (sustained later by the television industry), the broadcasting stations control their licensed portion of the broadcast spectrum 24/7 for free .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As tenants they pay nothing to the Federal Communications Commission , which represents the landlords , who are the people .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These free licenses allow radio and television stations to exclusively decide who gets airtime and who does not .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Entertainment and advertisements now make up over 90 percent of the broadcasting time of these very profitable commercial stations , using our public airwaves .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For many decades, the federal government has used taxpayer-funded research and development as hand-outs for private industries in the US .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For instance ,  the research and development of the Pentagon has resulted in technologies that built the aero-space, computer and containerisation industries .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was the Pentagon that funded the basic and applied research that led to the creation of the Internet .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The anti-cancer drug, Taxol, was developed with $31m of taxpayer funds by the National Cancer Institute and, after clinical testing, given away to Bristol- Myers-Squibb under a monopoly marketing agreement .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The biotechnology industry was formed out of free NIH research programmes .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Without a century of freely transferred research and development investments by the US Department of Agriculture, pesticide, herbicide and other chemical industries would not be where they are today .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the state and local level, companies and their consulting firms put the location of new factories, warehouses or large retail stores up for bidding by the states and municipalities .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It becomes a race to the bottom by states and municipalities competing against each other to create the most ""business friendly environment"" with incentives like tax breaks, cash donations and other subsidies to convince companies to locate to a community called corporate welfare or crony capitalism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These deals amount to governments paying companies to make money while depleting their public tax base that pays for schools, public works and other public services .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Recently, Tesla, the electric car company, put the location of a proposed one billion dollar factory to produce lithium ion batteries up for bid .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Texas, California, Arizona, and Nevada offered large giveaways in incentive subsidies .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nevada won , offering a package worth at least $1bn that included tax vacations, cash reimbursements of expenses and even a cash bonus for signing .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similarly ,  professional sports businesses have routinely demanded taxpayer- funded stadiums and ballparks as a condition of either staying in a city or relocating to another .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many billions of dollars have been spent to make these rich football and baseball giants even richer .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is money that could have been spent to create and improve neighbourhood recreational facilities for participatory sports and healthy exercise .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Under those corporate subsidies, the taxpayers are paying far too much (sometimes between $100,000 to $200,000 per job) for their governments' race to the bottom during these bidding wars .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are many thousands of similar corporate subsidy programmes , which are not regularly reviewed by the federal government .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead ,  Congress just lets them continue on indefinitely without regulatory standards, cost-benefit tests or sunset provisions , which is exactly what these corporate lobbyists are paying for with their ample campaign contributions to these indentured legislators .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grove was candid when he told the Senators that his industry was not very eager to spend money to do basic research .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A spectre is haunting Germany and Europe and the spectre is called PEGIDA .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Until recently only a few people had heard of PEGIDA, acronym for ""Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the Occident."" It started as a small protest movement in the eastern city of Dresden against the influx of immigrants, foreign workers and asylum seekers and, above all, against the ""Islamisation"" of Germany .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Adopting the slogan ""We are the people"" of the weekly anti-communist demonstrations in 1989 which ultimately led to the overthrow of the German Democratic Republic , PEGIDA's appeal seems to have grown week after week .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The hundreds of demonstrators of the first few Monday evening ""walks"" in Dresden have swollen to tens of thousands .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Besides Dresden, there are now similar weekly rallies in other big German cities .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With its history of anti-Semitism and fascism many find it shocking that a considerable number of Germans, particularly in the east of the country, are flocking to a xenophobic, racist and Islamophobic movement .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The surge of the anti-Islamisation movement has led to polarisation of the public opinion, many counter demonstrations and a fierce public debate, involving politicians, church leaders and academics .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chancellor Angela Merkel strongly criticised PEGIDA and called on Germans not to attend their rallies .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In fact the CSU's positions on immigration, integration and tougher rules for asylum seekers are quite similar to PEGIDA's .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It may well be that the CSU is distancing itself from Merkel because it is worried about right-wing competitors like the anti-establishment and eurosceptic AfD, Alternative fur Deutschland (Germany's Alternative) .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The AfD may succeed in winning over many of the PEGIDA-sympathisers .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"AfD-chairman Bernd Lucke has gone out of his way to advocate a dialogue with this ""new civil movement"" and listen carefully to its arguments .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the same time Lucke tried carefully not to alienate the more ""respectable"" right-wing voters and to distance himself from a too xenophobic discourse .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other AfD leaders are less ambiguous and clearly show support of PEGIDA by participating in their marches and inviting PEGIDA organisers to Saxony's regional parliament .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some German observers don't doubt the existence of an alliance between AfD and PEGIDA .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Sydney siege saw a slew of Muslim organisations issue statements condemning Islamic extremism .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Such chastisement had meant something in the wake of 9/11 and the Bali bombings .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today, this has degraded into an automated knee-jerk response .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has been said so many times that its gravitas is greatly diminished .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More subtly , this expectation for Muslims to keep speaking out is nothing short of Islamophobic .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It assumes that Islam is, at its core, evil .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It also upholds the view that Muslims can be essentialised as a monolithic whole .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chastisement thus becomes the yardstick from which the wider world is to differentiate between a good Muslim and a bad Muslim .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Surely today, fourteen years after 9/11, we have wisened up to the fact that such atrocious acts are committed out of political, even criminal, intent more than theology .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Surely ,  it is not a stretch to think that no one individual can represent an entire faith community . Surely ,  it is time , as Max Fisher of Vox argues , to stop asking Muslims to condemn terrorism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the same manner, this good Muslim, bad Muslim binary undergirds the #illridewithyou campaign .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, the hashtag was borne out of goodwill ; an Asian Australian woman started it , as the Twitter universe reacted to the story of a woman pledging to walk in solidarity with another woman who took her hijab off following news of the Sydney siege .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We will protect the good Muslims, so gestures the campaign .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unfortunately, it also reproduces an age-old trope that has been highlighted by scholars of postcolonial studies .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As western colonisers encounter non-European natives , they began to think of their ""other"" in one of two antithetical ways - either as a barbaric savage or a noble savage .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To the colonisers, the hostile savage is inherently dangerous in a sub-human way and always an enemy to the civilised individual .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile ,  the noble savage is romanticised as innately benign .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Untouched by modernisation , the noble savage should be admired and protected .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Transposed to modern times , the hostile savage translates as the bad Muslim and the noble savage - the good Muslim .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  barbaric or noble, a savage is still a savage .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The hashtag #illridewithyou is just as patronising .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Another factor that cast doubt to #illridewithyou relates to this question : Was the perpetrator Man Haron Monis the quintessential Islamic extremist? If the slate of profile pieces that are now just flooding our newsfeed can be taken as a gauge , the jury is still out on this .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At first glance, one may indeed be tempted to fit him into the mould of what some security experts have called ""bedroom jihadists"", a fashionable term to describe self-radicalised individuals who have been recruited online to plan and execute terror attacks that would advance the cause of clandestine Islamist organisations .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet Monis was a man of many masks .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Closer inspection would reveal that he does not nestle comfortably into this category .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His demands may have included an ISIL flag , but he made no strategic overtures that would advance the cause of any oppressed Muslim groups .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At this juncture, it is doubtful if he had even made contact with ISIL .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let us also not forget that Monis was not a nobody who was secretly being turned to the ways of ISIL or any other Islamist agenda .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  he was a well-known criminal .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not only had Monis been charged with being an accessory to the brutal murder of his wife last year , he had also been slapped with 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition ,  information has surfaced that he had been charged with fraud in Iran , which requested his extradition from Australia some 14 years ago .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a friend rightly pointed out on social media , Monis' criminal records qualify him as a ""sexual predator and misogynist"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  this more dominant aspect of his identity has not stopped the rest of the world from linking the Sydney siege to the threat of Islamic fundamentalism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet consider this .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During the Sydney siege, a shooting spree incidence unfolded in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania that left 6 dead .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same can be observed of the reaction to the mass killings committed by the Norwegian Anders Breivik in 2011 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While Breivik had claimed himself a baptised Christian in his 1,500-page manifesto , the world did not expect Christians to condemn terrorism in the same way Muslims had .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The untold thousands of peaceful protesters and activists rotting in Egypt's jails and the cult of personality today surrounding President Abdel Fattah el - Sisi tell the story of how the reluctant decision by Tahrir's revolutionaries to agree to a military-led transition turned out .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Tunisia, the elements of the state, such as the interior ministry, remain bastions of the ancien regime .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the country has undeniably moved further than any Arab country towards a real and sustainable democracy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This should not surprise anyone familiar with Tunisia's history , as the country boasts the Arab - indeed, Muslim  - world's first modern constitution, from 1861, and has long been among the most cosmopolitan and open in the region .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the central issue today is precisely how the country built its post-Ben Ali leadership .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whatever one wants to say about the Islamist Nahda Party , its spiritual and political leader Rachid Ghannoushi re-entered Tunisian politics with a long history of supporting pluralism and democracy .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And when it was clear that the party could not govern effectively , it ceded power and agreed to new elections , while members have engaged in public self-criticism about its failings .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Equally if not more important , Marzouki is one of the Arab world's most respected human rights figures , whose Congress for the Republic Party has brought together various opposition tendencies since its creation in 2001 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His term in office has been far from a sterling success - it could not have been otherwise , given the Herculean task of building a new governing system on the still functioning body of Ben Ali's mafia state .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But despite political assassinations, flaring religious extremism, and deep- seated economic problems , the country has moved to solidify a new civil and democratic political system .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The contrast with the Egyptian post-revolutionary leadership couldn't be clearer .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are many structural reasons why Tunisia has progressed politically while Egypt has seemingly returned to its pharaonic roots (as many commentators like to describe its penchant for authoritarian leaders) .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The most prominent are the exponentially greater power of the Egyptian military vis-a-vis its North African counterpart and its far larger, and poorer, population .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But I would argue that the centrality, at least politically, of human rights to the national discourse has been one of the unheralded heroes of the post- revolutionary period .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just compare Tunisia and its president with the situation in Egypt .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Abdel Basset Hassan, head of the Arab Institute for Human Rights in Tunis and a long-time resident of Cairo, explained to me when we met in September , human rights are clearly being institutionalised to a strong degree .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The problem is that human rights is a frail political discourse .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whether in the most ""advanced"" democracies like the United States and UK, or developing countries like Egypt and Tunisia , it's easily swept aside by appeals to core national and/or religious identities and the creation of threats whose defeat inevitably requires watering down the protections afforded to all citizens .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More broadly, human rights exists in a contradictory political framework : In most societies they both require revolutionary change to be fully implemented and yet are routinely violated in revolutionary situations where one form of power is, more or less violently , overpowering and superseding another .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As revolutions from Iran to Cuba have shown , its all too easy for revolutions fought in the name of human rights, justice and dignity to themselves produce violent and repressive systems .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What's more , human rights is intimately tied to a notion of individual personhood that can all too easily be hijacked to a kind of market fundamentalist liberalism in which broad political freedom masks incredibly deep and destruction inequalities, exploitation, and repression - whether of colonised peoples ""outremer"" or of working classes at home .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  for anyone who's experienced the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions in action , the power and importance of human rights is undeniable .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It remains one of the most radical concepts of the modern era; first , because it demands recognising others as inherently equal to oneself regardless of their differences - ethnic, racial, gender, religion, class, or nation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second ,  they demand strict limitation on state power which is inherently and , unless checked , normatively abusive of citizens .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And this is where the situation in Tunisia remains perilous despite the smooth parliamentary and presidential elections of the last two months .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While Marzouki's Congress for the Republic party represents a poorer and more traditional (and southern) component of Tunisian society , Essebsi's Nida Tounes Party is not merely tied to the old regime, but to the international financial interests to which it was beholden .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  the main threat in Tunisia today, in this regard, is not a religious - secular divide but left-neoliberal, with the two powerful parties working together to suppress all opposition to once again making Tunisia the Arab world's ""poster child"" for a ""broken down"" neoliberal reform model which has always produced - and masked - the desperate inequalities that led to the revolution against Ben Ali in the first place .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For decades, neoliberalism has produced the same results most everywhere it has been implemented: aggregate growth that mask growing inequality, increasing corruption, crime, environmental degradation and repression .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The only check on such policies would be a strong and united left (the opposite of the present situation, by some accounts) centred broadly on labour rights, a fair distribution of wealth and resources and fighting against the corruption that fatally weakened the previous state .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But one of the signature strengths of neoliberal ideologies, from Kansas to Cairo, is precisely how efficiently they motivate people to support leaders and policies that are manifestly against their economic interests .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Nida Tounes-Nahda alignment would provide a powerful ideological and political cover for retrenching the policies that brought Tunisia to the brink of revolution .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the other hand ,  there are more positive countervailing forces at work in Tunis that are cause for long-term hope .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This process is exemplified by the establishment of Dar Essaida, or Saida House, a human rights centre located in and emerging from the local community in one of Tunis' poorest quarters .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Hassan explained , encouraging the poor and working class to (re) define the political and cultural discourses of human rights in ways that reflect their struggles and desires marks an important moment in the evolution of human rights practice .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""It's about implementing a complete vision , and as important , getting it out to the widest public,"" Hassan declared .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""This is the only way to strengthen advances in areas such as women's rights or constitutional reforms .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the culture is harder to change , and you can't just root out all the networks of the former mafia state in one year, or even ten .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's a long process and it's not fruitful to use the angle of 'better or worse' to judge it now.""",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It has been a week of air strikes ""whodunnit"" mysteries in the Middle East .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, Al Jazeera broke the news that Iranian F-4 Phantoms were bombing ISIL in Iraq .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Iranians initially denied being in the same airspace bombing the same enemies as the Americans but later came clean about their role to the Guardian .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We've also heard rumours of the US A-10 ""tank buster"" arriving to support the US mission in Iraq although , again ,  nothing has been confirmed at this point .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then ,  on as normal a Sunday as Damascus has experienced in the last few years , the Syrian regime released grainy photographs supposedly showing the trails of Israeli aircraft following a bombing run on targets in the area .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Among the rumoured sites that were hit were areas of Damascus International Airport .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This caps a busy weekend for Syria's airbases which withstood ISIL attacks in the east of the country on Saturday .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While at a tactical level it is impossible to understand what impact the strikes have had , at a political level it works for all sides .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Syrian regime has used its conflict with Israel to justify an internal state of emergency and restrictions to freedoms for decades and can now sell to the war weary public who remain in their controlled areas , the twin threat of ISIL and Israeli ""terrorism"" .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Benjamin Netanyahu, with elections looming, there is no better time for Israel's prime minister to act ""prime ministerial"" and remind voters of his eternal vigilance of the threat coming from Syria .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  earlier in the week, Netanyahu said that Israel ""is following the Middle East and what is happening very closely, with wide open eyes and ears - and a lot is happening ... We will continue to keep our fingers on the pulse and we will deal with these threats and these challenges , which never take time off"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a letter to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Syria's foreign ministry claimed the bombing happened to distract from the break up of Netanyahu's coalition .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Israeli officials meanwhile, would neither confirm nor deny the attacks with an Israeli army spokesman saying he would not comment on the ""foreign reports"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While Syrian state media should always be read with a healthy pinch of salt , if confirmed , the latest Israeli attack comes in a series that preceded the outbreak of civil war .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a certain format to this low level state of eternal conflict between the two parties .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Israel's September 2007 attack on Syria's al-Kibar facility was again initially unconfirmed but would eventually be told as a strategic masterstroke taking down Syria's nuclear programme at a critical time .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Following the attacks , Syria responded with bombastic rhetoric over what it would do in the face of the strikes but nothing ever happened .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the Syrian uprising and civil war, Israel's primary concern has been with certain types of hi-tech weaponry going to Hezbollah , which was used to explain strikes in January and May of 2013 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A year later and Israel responded to the very physical spillover of the Syrian conflict by launching strikes in June 2014 after shells were fired at their positions on the Golan Heights .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Syria responded to the January bombings by warning of a ""surprise"" , but in fact their actual reaction has been predictably mute .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The airspace over Syria has never been busier with different nations pursuing different enemies with metrics of success hard to distinguish among the smoke and debris of the destruction .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This weekend's attacks , if they are eventually claimed by Israel , would further entrench the growing irrelevance of many of the region's borders as recognised and respected lines .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While the focus of global attention has been on ISIL's dismantling of the Iraq-Syria border , the Lebanon-Syria border is also becoming functionally blurred and clearly no longer deters Israel's strategic decision makers .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the most immediate level, the strikes will likely embolden Assad to play a traditional nationalist card to strengthen support among his remaining loyalists .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over in Israel , Netanyahu can appear to be making statesmanlike decisions ahead of a likely bruising election and it cannot be a coincidence that he was in the US when the bombing happened - a nod perhaps to a US green light and the durability of that continued relationship .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"During a radio interview this week, French President Francois Hollande said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""doesn't want to annex eastern Ukraine  - he told me that"" .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He even suggested that western sanctions should be eased .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hollande's naivety harks back to George W Bush's infamous comments about Putin in 2001 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When asked by a reporter if he could trust Putin , he responded ; ""I looked the man in the eye .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy ... I was able to get a sense of his soul."" As a former KGB officer, Putin probably looked into Bush's eyes and saw a case number!  In reality ,  Putin has done nothing to demonstrate that his commitment to Hollande is genuine .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crimea is still under the control of Russia after its illegal annexation last year .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Moscow continues to occupy the Georgian breakaway provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russian weapons and equipment are still pouring into eastern Ukraine .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As recently as last November, NATO confirmed another build-up of Russian military equipment and troops inside Ukraine .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia's next moves .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In light of Russia's recent behaviour, what can be expected in eastern Ukraine in 2015? Predictions of this sort are almost impossible and are usually invariably wrong .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  it is possible to develop various scenarios that could offer a glimpse into what Russia's plans might be .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia's ultimate goal is to keep Ukraine out of the transatlantic community - the EU and NATO .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia will also want to consolidate the gains made by separatist forces in eastern Ukraine .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To this end, Russia will have short-term and long term goals .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The primary short-term goal for Russia in Ukraine will be to keep the conflict in eastern Ukraine ""frozen"" - meaning that while the bullets might stop flying , there will be no real effort to bring a conclusive end to the conflict .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This equates to victory for Moscow and defeat for Kiev because it leaves Ukraine not in control of all its territory .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia can also use the ""frozen"" status of separatist-controlled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as bargaining chips in future talks with the West on other issues .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In terms of Russia's longer term goals in Ukraine for 2015 and beyond, there are a number of scenarios that can play out .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is safe to assume that Moscow will help the separatists consolidate gains in Donetsk and Luhansk to create a political entity that becomes more like a viable state .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This will be no easy task and will require the capture of important communication and transit nodes, such as Donetsk airport, the city of Mariupol and its port, and the Luhansk power plant .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These are still under Ukrainian government control but are all needed if the separatists want to achieve true autonomy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A more ambitious scenario might see Russia expanding separatist-controlled areas to include the entire eastern region of Ukraine consisting of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and the eastern sections of Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv oblasts .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This would require capturing Kharkiv , which is Ukraine's second largest city .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kharkiv also holds a certain degree of symbolism for those in Moscow dreaming of the days of Soviet glory - it was the first city in Ukraine to recognise the Bolshevik takeover in 1917 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most aggressive scenario might see Moscow attempting to re-establish control of the historical Novorossiya region in modern-day southern Ukraine .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This would create a land bridge between Russia and Crimea  - eventually linking up with the Russian-backed Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This would be no easy undertaking and would require the capture of the heavily defended cities of Mariupol and Odessa, Ukraine's tenth-largest and third- largest cities, respectively .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia is desperate to establish a land bridge to Crimea since the cost of providing goods and services by sea and air to the peninsula is becoming prohibitively expensive .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  Putin has ordered a bridge linking the Russian mainland with Crimea to be built by 2018 .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With an economy in recession, the collapse of the rouble, and the low price of oil , finding the $5.2bn required to build the bridge might not be possible .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead ,  Russia could be forced into creating a land bridge to Crimea .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Out of all of Russia's previous leaders, Putin has more in common with Russia's imperial czars than he does with the Soviet premiers .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perhaps Putin has most in common with Emperor Nicolas I who ruled Russia between 1825 and 1855 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nicolas I's reign was marked by a stagnate economy, territorial expansions in the Caucasus, the crushing of political dissent, and a war in Crimea .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the case of Nicolas I, his war in Crimea was disastrous and could have had serious implications for his rule if he had not died from pneumonia before the war ended .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will Crimea prove the same for Putin today? Only time will tell .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One thing is for certain : Russia's designs on eastern Ukraine are far from over, 2015 will prove to be a very interesting year .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
