"A British author, residing in the United States for the past 30 years, created a small firestorm earlier this week with his candid observations that modern - day Americans have been duped by the government into accepting a European - style march toward socialism because we fail to appreciate the rich legacy of personal liberty that is everyone's birthright and is expressly articulated in the Declaration of Independence and guaranteed by the U.S  Constitution .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Rather than learn anything from this unhappy history , however ,  Argentina is opting for stubbornness, bullying and intimidation of its debt-holders, all with a helping hand from the United Nations , as it refuses to pay back bondholders for billions of dollars .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What Argentina wants is to establish ""a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes."" Such a multilateral endeavor -- established, run, and funded by governments -- will no doubt be more sympathetic to financial deadbeats like Argentina than a U.S  court that has to give equal standing to the private sector .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's also the kind of thing that the United Nations loves to endorse : high- minded and technical sounding, larded with ostensible respect for international legal processes, and standing above any single national interest--with absolutely no chance whatsoever that it will be any of these things .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sure enough, Argentina has successfully rallied a majority of U.N  member nations to join in denouncing Argentina's debt holders and endorsing its multilateral debt restructuring framework .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This September the U.N  General Assembly voted 124-11, with 41 abstentions , to support Argentina's position .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The U.N  Human Rights Council soon followed suit , adopting a similar resolution 33-5 , with 9 abstentions .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The notorious Council , which includes some of the world's worst human rights violators in its membership , got involved because it says excessive debt is an impediment to full realization of ""social, economic and cultural"" rights .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is certainly true that debt defaults take a huge toll because the defaulting country loses access to international financial markets and foreign exchange , limiting its ability to finance expenditures and obligations and pay for imported goods .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"But Argentina's latest default is is different from earlier defaults , which were driven by economic crises .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In 2012, a U.S  judge ruled in their favor and further ruled that any financial institution that assisted in partial payment would be in contempt .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Following the court's ruling, Argentina could have complied or at least paid interest on the bonds while trying to renegotiate a more favorable debt arrangement .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Of course ,  it never mentions that it was Argentina that voluntarily issued the debt in the first place, presumably in good faith .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nor does it acknowledge that the government's own reckless economic policies precipitated the debt crisis in the first place .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you think that sort of dishonest name-calling would fall on deaf ears , you don't know the United Nations .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Argentina's success in rallying a majority of U.N  member nations to join in denouncing the debt holders results from an underlying fact .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"BUFFALO, N.Y  - Even a $50 million budget deficit in the Buffalo school district couldn't convince members of the Buffalo Federation of Teachers to cut down on their taxpayer-funded tummy tucks, breast lifts and nose jobs .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  school district spending on the unique benefit, known as a ""cosmetic rider"" on the insurance plan for union members, totaled $5.4 million in 2013-14, an increase of 4.1 percent from 2012-2013 and an increase of 9.5 percent from two years ago, according to public records information obtained exclusively by EAGnews .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As an indication of just how much the perk is being utilized, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons , the average cost of rhinoplasty is $4,545 , while the average cost of liposuction is $2,866 .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A breast lift costs $4,207, on average .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In other words ,  over 1,200 Buffalo teachers union members could have had a boob job last year, at taxpayer expense .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The annual expenditure is staggering, given the district's troubled financial situation , not to mention its sketchy academic performance .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In January 2014, the Buffalo News reported that the school district was grappling with a $50 million budget deficit for the 2013-14 school year .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""That gives us very little wiggle room to fund anything new,"" Barbara Smith, the district's chief financial officer, told the school board .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Except, of course, for a lot of new cosmetic medical procedures for teachers .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ""cosmetic rider"" benefit has been offered to teachers for decades and has been scrutinized only recently due to the school district's financial plight .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The school board has been unwilling to impose a new labor agreement without the rider , as allowed by law .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the district has been operating under the terms of an old agreement  - which includes the cosmetic rider - that expired about 10 years ago .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Until the union agrees to a new contract without the perk , the school district will continue paying .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That possibility has been discussed for years , but the union has never budged .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""There's no co-pay (for cosmetic procedures) , so the school district ends up footing the entire bill,"" The Atlantic reported in 2012 .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps if the Buffalo school district produced great academic results, and students who were prepared for college or the working world upon graduation , taxpayers could justify such a cushy benefit for teachers .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But that's clearly not the case .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The district recently boasted that its graduation rate improved from a miserable 47.8 percent to 56 percent .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So slightly more than half of the students are now getting a diploma , which is hardly a reason to celebrate .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The district's latest student proficiency numbers are ugly, as well .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to the Buffalo News, only 12.2 percent of Buffalo students rated proficient or better on recent standardized English tests , while only 13.1 percent rated proficient or better in math .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So what has this teaching staff accomplished that merits a benefit as costly and wasteful as free cosmetic surgery?  The June 2014 union newsletter - appropriately named The Provocator - includes ads from three cosmetic service providers pedaling procedures like Botox, cosmetic breast and body contouring, facelifts, hair transplantation, and ""medispa"" treatments .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Those ads are bound to pay off for the providers , because the teachers can obtain their pricey services for free - at our expense, of course .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a chance that the cosmetic rider could finally be abolished through labor negotiations .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most recently , an outside mediator proposed giving teachers an 11.8 percent pay increase , and in exchange they would pay a ""small"" amount toward their own health insurance .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The proposal also calls for ending the plastic surgery coverage , according to the Buffalo News .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While completely eliminating the ""cosmetic rider"" from its benefits package would not plug the $50 million budget hole , the annual expense is an indication that the school board is not serious about reining in out of control spending, nor making sure every dollar is going directly towards the education of children .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"For Edelman to use his advantage as a lawyer to berate the Duan family who have come from nothing as immigrants and are trying their best to make a living running a restaurant is, in a word, unconscionable .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During one email exchange , Duan asked the professor , ""you seem like a smart man ... don't you have better things to do?"" Bullies usually don't .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For all I know , Edelman is a pretty good professor .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That does not make him a good person .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Teaching at Harvard may be a lofty achievement in the egg-head world .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An Army chaplain was punished for discussing matters of faith and quoting from the Bible during a suicide prevention training session with the 5th Ranger Training Battalion -- leading to outrage from religious liberty groups and a Georgia congressman .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chaplain Joseph Lawhorn was issued a Letter of Concern that accused him of advocating for Christianity and ""using Christian scripture and solutions"" during a Nov  20th training session held at the University of North Georgia .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""This made it impossible for those in attendance to receive the resource information without also receiving the biblical information.""

"""The fact that one person in the class was offended changes nothing.""  Congressman Doug Collins, a Republican lawmaker from Georgia , whose district includes the area where the training session took place , fired off a letter to Col  Fivecoat expressing his concerns in the matter .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Mary, the mother of Jesus, features prominently in our Christmas celebrations .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Christmas carols, greeting cards and nativity reenactments all celebrate the important role she played in the birth of the Messiah .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But what about Joseph? What does the Christmas story say about the role of fathers? The Gospel of Matthew, written in the second half of the first century to a predominantly Jewish audience, places Joseph at the center of the birth of Christ .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Complimentary to the Gospel of Luke where most of the activity centers on Mary , Matthew reports that it is Joseph that is instructed by an angel in a dream not to call off his impending marriage to Mary .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Joseph is pictured as a decisive leader, protector and provider for his family in this Gospel .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The birth narratives of Jesus in Matthew, not only highlights the importance of family as the building block of a stable society, but also communicates the importance of fathers in the raising of children .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With Joseph as our example, four lessons for fathers can be taken from this Christmas story .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First , to be a father is not just a biological description .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Joseph was not the physical father of Jesus , but as instructed by the angel took Mary as his wife and provided a home for Jesus .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Being a father is a matter of the heart .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joseph is a great role model for those fathers that have chosen to raise non - biological children as their own .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fathers create homes for children by enlarging their hearts and providing a safe and nurturing environment for them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second ,  fathers model good values to their children .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Matthew calls Joseph a just man .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is in sharp contrast to the wicked Herod in the same Gospel , who kills numerous boys in his narcissistic rage as he attempts to remove the pending threat of the birth of the King of the Jews .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are inundated with so many painful recollections of fathers that did not match the expectations of their children .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good fathers embody the moral and hopeful ideals of their children .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They model the way .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Third ,  fathers do all in their power to protect their family .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Joseph, warned in a dream about the murderous plans of Herod, moves his family to the safety of Egypt .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This selfless act of Joseph illustrates what good fathers do best - they place the interest of their families above their own .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lastly, fathers provide a future for their children .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Once again, Matthew records that Joseph in returning from Egypt scanned the environment and decided to move Jesus and Mary to Galilee, far from the watchful eye of Archelaus, the ruler that succeeded Herod .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good fathers recognize that fathering does not end when children turn of age .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fathers consider the future of their children beyond their own mortality and work to provide a prosperous and successful future for them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perhaps the time has come to reconsider the role of Joseph in our celebration of Christmas .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"May we rediscover not only his good example, but the stabilizing and transformative effect that good fathers have on children, families and societies .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can dread the holidays as a passive bystander or you can actively shape your experience of them to be life-giving .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your choice will reaffirm whether you choose to be fully alive in the present or not .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All too often I hear people express angst about holiday gatherings that they feel obligated to attend .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To be certain there are gatherings such as work related events where your absence would not serve you well .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Those who anticipate the holidays share a sense of gladness and expectation about being with at least some of the guests .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their anticipation is usually grounded in a well-developed self-awareness which accepts others as they are and an ability to not get caught up in the drama or baggage of others .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These three tools to create a life-giving experience of the holiday season can also be applied to other work or family events .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 \. Detach to Engage .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You are not obligated to engage in or endure lengthy and painful conversations with those whose energy, attitude or chip on their shoulder sucks the spirit out of you or others .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Those are their issues and choices, not yours .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You are not responsible for their behavior and you cannot change it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can be polite and detach .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Detachment is the practice that reflects your grounding as a compassionate and courageous person .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With loving intention you entrust the well-being of the person you detach from to the goodness of the Universe .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not an expression of anger or righteousness but an act of hoping for their highest good .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It frees you both .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your detachment allows you to be fully present to the positive energy of other guests .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 \. Frame New Conversations .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One woman found herself filled with anxiety at the thought of family holiday events .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She dreaded the sexist, racist and homophobic jokes or comments that would be offered .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She thought about abandoning her family's events .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instead she decided that she did not want to walk away as a helpless victim .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She prepared herself with stories to tell in response to the inevitable offensive comments .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When she told those stories - attending the wedding of two women at her church, getting to know Latino immigrants through her volunteer work - she discovered that the landscape changed .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Her stories invited connection to real human beings beyond labels and crude jokes .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Her experience of the family gatherings began to shift .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 \. Name Your Gratitude .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your gratitude is a reflection of the rich variety of relationships and experiences that shape your life .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It can only be compromised by the negative or toxic behavior of others if you allow them to elbow your gratitude to the sidelines .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In preparation for the center of the holiday season take a few minutes each day to name or write down one person or experience you are grateful for .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This practice creates a heartfelt mosaic of gratefulness .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Express your thankfulness to each of the people you have named and the particular experiences they may have shaped .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you will not see them in person express your gratitude via a note, email or social media tool imp .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you are with the person be prepared for how you will convey your heartfelt thanks .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Naming your gratitude creates a mindful way of appreciating your interconnection with others .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When you detach in order to engage, frame new conversations and name your gratitude you choose to be present to yourself and others in life-affirming ways .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These choices unclutter the angst or apprehension you might feel .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They allow you to experience holiday gatherings in unexpected and positive ways .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How will you be proactive in your choices?,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It will encourage terrorists around the world to launch revenge attacks .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It will cause foreign intelligence agencies to clam up and no longer cooperate with US intelligence for fear that their sources and method will be blown .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It will cause every American intelligence officer to go into the defensive crouch -- don't stick your head out to protect America because years later somebody in government who wants to score political points will chop it off .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally ,  take a lesson from history .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But his handiwork crippled American intelligence gathering for a generation .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"American agents overseas were killed , foreign intelligence agencies stopped sharing intelligence with us , our own human networks collapsed , and CIA officers played it safe and stopped thinking outside the box .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was one of the reasons a generation later we never knew about a bunch of Islamic extremists in a cave in Afghanistan plotting to take down the Twin Towers .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Releasing the report to the public will do considerable harm to our efforts to gather essential intelligence about those hoping to do us harm .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It will be a self-inflicted wound .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The next time we are caught unprepared it won' t just be with 747s flying into buildings it could be with weapons too terrible to contemplate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One can only conclude that the senator and her acolytes are attempting not to reform our intelligence practices but to re-write their own role in what transpired .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The senator and her colleagues (from both parties) were briefed in detail on every activity field agents took to protect us from further attacks .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The senator and her colleagues (as well as the Department of Justice) approved every one of those practices .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now , the senator's saying , ""Even if we knew , we didn't know."" Perhaps she is, indeed , suffering a much-delayed attack of conscience , but the awareness that the incoming Republican-majority Congress would never release such a biased report surely plays a role .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His desk was piled high with documents he said were mainly reports from the CIA .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He told me he had come to regret he had been such a vigorous supporter of the gutting of that agency that followed the suggestions of the so-called Church Committee on which Mondale had served as a Senator .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His comment was an isolated one and I merely listened .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the effects of the Church Committee recommendations were damaging to the CIA and the remedial work took years .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every forty years we may have to endure periodic reports like those produced under Senators Church and Feinstein that represent well intentioned reviews of the intelligence community .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The suggested reforms speak of following our sense of justice and fairness and civility .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The problem is obvious : Our enemies do not play fair and war is Hell .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Any reforms of the intelligence universe cannot easily be effected .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The idea of a transparent intelligence agency is an inherent contradiction .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Moreover how can Congress talk openly of reforms without damaging our intelligence efforts? And politicians are among those least likely to be willing to accept the secrecy that is at the core of any well managed intelligence agency .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can we imagine a Congress that can keep the secrets?  The new flurry of attacks on the intelligence community -- harmful and unnecessary-- will not have any more lasting impact than did the indictment of Helms or the work of the Church Committee .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here is what happened .,other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last week was dominated by two huge news stories .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One was the revelation by the Senate Intelligence Committee of torture committed by CIA agents and contractors on 119 detainees in the post-9/11 era -- 26 of whom were tortured for months by mistake .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In that revelation of anguish and error were the conclusions by CIA agents themselves that their torture had not produced helpful information .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Obama acknowledged that the CIA had tortured , yet he directed the Department of Justice not to prosecute those who tortured and those who authorized it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The other substantial news story was the compromise achieved by Congress and the White House to fund the government through the end of September 2015 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That legislation , which is 2,000 pages in length , was not read by anyone who voted for it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It spends a few hundred billion dollars more than the government will collect in tax revenue .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The compromise was achieved through bribery ; members of Congress bought and sold votes by adding goodies (in the form of local expenditures of money borrowed by the federal government) to the bill that were never debated or independently voted upon and were added solely to achieve the votes needed for passage .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is how the federal government operates today .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both parties participate in it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They have turned the public treasury into a public trough .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hidden in the law that authorized the government to spend more than it will collect was a part about funding for the 16 federal civilian intelligence agencies .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And hidden in that was a clause, inserted by the same Senate Intelligence Committee that revealed the CIA torture , authorizing the National Security Agency to gather and retain nonpublic data for five years and to share it with law enforcement and with foreign governments .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Nonpublic data"" is the government's language referring to the content of the emails, text messages, telephone calls, bank statements, utility bills and credit card bills of nearly every innocent person in America -- including members of Congress, federal judges, public officials and law enforcement officials .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I say ""innocent"" because the language of this legislation  -- which purports to make lawful the NSA spying we now all know about -- makes clear that those who spy upon us needn't have any articulable suspicion or probable cause for spying .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The need for articulable suspicion and probable cause has its origins in the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution , which was written to prohibit what Congress just authorized .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That amendment was a reaction to the brutish British practice of rummaging through the homes of American colonists, looking for anything that might be illegal .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is also a codification of our natural right to privacy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It requires that if the government wants nonpublic data from our persons, houses, papers or effects , it must first present evidence of probable cause to a judge and then ask the judge for a search warrant .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probable cause is a level of evidence that is sufficient to induce a judge into concluding that it is more likely than not that the place to be examined contains evidence of crimes .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to seek probable cause , the government must first have an articulable suspicion about the person or place it has targeted .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Were this not in the law , then nothing would stop the government from fishing expeditions in pursuit of anyone it wants to pursue .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And fishing expeditions turn the presumption of liberty on its head .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The presumption of liberty is based on the belief that our rights are natural to us and that we may exercise them without a permission slip from the government and without its surveillance .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Until last week, that is .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last week, Congress, by authorizing the massive NSA spying to continue and by authorizing the spies to share what they have seized with law enforcement , basically permitted the fishing expeditions that the Fourth Amendment was written to prevent .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Justices of the Connecticut Supreme Court took over parenting duties of a cancer-stricken teenager Thursday .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In so doing , they surely saved her life .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the conclusion of oral arguments, the high court took just minutes to determined that state officials were right to take custody of the girl known in court documents only as ""Cassandra C "" and force her to undergo life-saving treatment .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No thanks to her mother .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jackie Fortin had encouraged her 17-year-old daughter's desire to refuse chemotherapy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She naively pronounced , ""my daughter is not going to die."" As if wishing it could make it come true .",other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sadly, both mother and daughter were wrong .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They were in denial .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If they got their way , Cassandra would die .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was the equivalent of suicide .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wonder how her mother would feel then?  Cassandra has advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma which attacks and consumes the body's immune system .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Her doctors say chemotherapy treatment will give her an 85 percent chance of survival .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent odds .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  the teenager refused , saying she did not want to ""poison"" her body with chemo .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How does that make sense to a rational mind? Let's employ Cassandra's own tortured terminology and logic .,other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Does she not realize that her body is already being poisoned by the rapidly multiplying cancer in her lymph system? Untreated , it will quickly spread until it kills her .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is what her doctors predict .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reliable statistics from the National Cancer Institute prove they are right .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chemotherapy can save her .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chemicals are introduced into the diseased body to attack the cancer cells .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You can call it a ""poison"" if you want , but a more accurate term is curative .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, the chemicals also harm other normal cells .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To that extent they are a poison, of sorts, producing painful and unpleasant side effects .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But once the body recovers and is free of the cancer cells , the chemicals are gone .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thus , if chemo is a poison , it is not normally a lethal one .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cancer which is ravaging Cassandra's body surely is .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If , by using the term ""poison,"" Cassandra means she does not want to endure the side effects of nausea, vomiting, hair loss and exhaustion cond , she is being myopic .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The final stages of untreated lymphoma are far more extreme and painful .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cassandra's disdain for the treatment that will likely save her young life is, perhaps , the best evidence that she was not mature enough to make a wise and informed decision on her own .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But then again, neither was her mother .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which is why the state of Connecticut stepped in .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As an adult, Fortin, is presumed to be competent under the law to make decisions for her daughter, a minor .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  Fortin's aberrant judgment in rejecting the treatment that could save Cassandra's life and her concomitant belief that her daughter would somehow, miraculously, not succumb to an insidious, fatal illness ... called that legal presumption into serious doubt .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is also evidence that Fortin ignored obvious signs of her daughter's malignant disease at an early stage, failed to seek prompt and continuing medical attention , and has been unduly influencing Cassandra's negative reaction to treatment .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The court records suggest a domineering mother with an abiding distrust of medicine , and a daughter fearful of running afoul of her mother's wishes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To deny a child beneficial , life-sustaining treatment constitutes child neglect .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
States have a duty to protect children from abuse and neglect .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Courts rarely hesitate to step in where a child's life is in danger .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thus , the state was correct to intervene and the lower court was equally correct to remove the mother as unfit .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fortunately, the Connecticut Supreme Court agreed and did the right thing .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Time is on Cassandra's side .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The fact that she is 9 months away from turning 18 years old may, in the end, have saved her life .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It gave the high court an excuse to adhere strictly to the law as it relates to protecting minors .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Those 9 months will also give doctors valuable time to complete her therapy and give her a new chance at a full and happy life .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"INDIANAPOLIS  - If success at the state level were enough to recommend someone for president of the United States , Gov  Mike Pence of Indiana would be among the frontrunners for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to the governor's office, Pence has ""signed into law $643 million in annual tax relief : That includes: $313 million for hardworking Hoosiers, thanks to last year's 5 percent income tax reduction, the largest state tax cut in Indiana history.""  In addition ,  the state corporate tax rate was reduced from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent , making it the third lowest in the country and contributing to Indiana's increase in the labor force , which , Pence's office says , has grown by more than 51,000 over the past year, five times the national growth rate .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It helps to have large majorities of one's party in the legislature , but Pence consults and has good relationships with Democrats , who frequently vote with the Republican majority because his programs work .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sitting with the governor in his high-ceiling office beneath portraits of two Indiana governors who became presidents of the United States -- William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison  -- Pence tells me he is focused on the upcoming legislative session , which is expected to last four months , and won't think seriously about running for president until the session ends .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then , he says , ""We'll probably take some time as a family to reflect and pray and make decisions about our future.""  In his mind, Pence may have already crafted a winning scenario .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He may be focused on his state , but he thinks a lot about the country , which he served for 10 years as a congressman .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A former Democrat (like his ideological mentor Ronald Reagan), Pence sees a need to transform his party's image : ""The Republican Party has become just the other party to Washington solutions .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have to get back to advancing state- based solutions and reforms .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We must be relentlessly optimistic.""  He paraphrases a Reagan line : ""' Why shouldn't we dream great dreams , after all we're Americans .' There was a confidence and optimism I think our party would do well to repair to .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"... There' s a lot wrong with our national government , but we've got to stop confusing our national government with our nation.""  That's a good line for a stump speech .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pence wants to move from opposing bad ideas in Washington, to focusing on the success records in many states .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example , Pence's education agenda includes a goal of taking children in underperforming schools and putting them in good schools : ""By the year 2020, I want 100,000 more Indiana students in high- quality schools than we have today .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today, we have 105,000 kids who are in underperforming or failing schools.""  He wants to fix traditional schools, pay good teachers more , giving bonuses to the best , and expand vocational education to every high school in the state .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""We have the largest education voucher program in America .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"That's why he thinks the eventual GOP nominee should do as George W  Bush did in 2000 : name a group of advisers with strong foreign policy credentials to advise him during a campaign and , if he is successful , some might serve in his administration .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It's wonderful (and a good thing) to see the new emphasis on ""giving over receiving"" at Christmas time .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's become a trend this year with so many families because as parents we want to teach kids about generosity .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moms and dads everywhere are using Christmas as an opportunity to get their kids thinking about serving others and giving to the less fortunate , rather than encouraging them to create monstrous Christmas lists describing all the things they want this season .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some parents are even ""cancelling"" Christmas for their kids , not giving any family members any gifts .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But do we really need to cancel Christmas in order to foster a spirit of generosity in our kids?  Wednesday I joined Lisa Henderson on ""Fox & Friends"" to debate this very question .",par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lisa has ""cancelled Christmas"" in her Utah home because , she says , her kids have become too entitled , ""acting so ungrateful"" and ""extremely disrespectful.""  So there will be no presents for Christmas , but , as she writes on her blog Overthebigmooon.com , ""There is a good possibility that Santa will be writing them a letter of how proud of them he is and perhaps put a few pieces of hard candy and an orange in their stockings.""  While I have great respect for what Lisa wants to accomplish , I disagree with her approach .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Christmas should begin, not end, at home .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are already under immense pressure to purge Christmas from our culture .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First nativity scenes in public places were under attack, now it's Christmas trees .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even saying ""Merry Christmas"" has taken a back seat to ""Happy Holidays.""  Cancelling Christmas and using letters from Santa to motivate our kids to be generous is not the answer .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The answer is in putting the emphasis on the miracle not the material .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And here's the good news .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even our gift giving can point to the miracle .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, yes, we give a few gifts to our kids .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But we also give many gifts to the less fortunate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example ,  we've taught our own kids that the gifts we give them at Christmas aren't based on whether they've been bad or good all year .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The gifts we give them are free , unearned, underserved gifts , just like the gift of Jesus is a free, unearned, and underserved gift .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a very tangible, concrete concept for kids to grasp .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And when we serve and give to others , we teach our kids what Jesus said in Matthew 25:40 : ""Whatever you do for the least of your brothers and sisters , you do for me.""  So we give gifts to Jesus on his ""birthday"" by serving and loving and giving to others!  This is how parents can infuse real meaning into Christmas -- not by refusing to celebrate it all together .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cancelling Christmas is simply not the key to fostering generosity in our kids .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The key to fostering generosity in our kids is by making giving something we do all year round . By making it a lifestyle .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And a lifestyle of giving springs from a deep well of gratitude for how Jesus first gave his life for us .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We have to be so careful not to teach our kids that Christmas is about doing more, trying harder, and being better to be worthy of gifts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Christmas is about anticipating and celebrating the greatest gift that has already been given -- the unconditional love of God in the birth of Jesus Christ .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our focus shouldn't be on whether or not we have a tree overflowing with gifts, but on whether we have a home overflowing with love .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ruling was made public Tuesday .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The EEOC determined there was reasonable cause to believe the Phillipsburg School District discriminated against Walt Tutka, a substitute teacher .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The EEOC also said religion and retaliation played a factor in Tutka's firing .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""This is a great indication the EEOC is taking religious liberty seriously and they are going to enforce the law -- and in this case make sure Walt's rights are protected,"" Liberty Institute attorney Hiram Sasser told me .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liberty Institute is a law firm that specializes in religious liberty cases .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""This sends a message to school districts that their natural allergic reaction to religion is misplaced , and not only is it wrong -- but it's also an egregious violation of the law,"" Sasser said .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As I first reported , Tutka was working as a substitute teacher on Oct  12, 2013 , when he ran afoul of school policies .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He told a straggling student at the end of a line, ""The first shall be last and the last shall be first.""  The student asked on a number of occasions where the line was from , and Tutka told him it was from the Bible .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When he discovered the child did not have a Bible , Tutka gave him his personal copy .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was not all that unusual because Tutka is a member of Gideons International, a ministry known for providing Bibles to school children across the world .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Do blacks trust police more than whites do? Given the anger over events in Ferguson and New York City, the very question seems absurd .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it is not .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Behind the polls and demonstrations, there is evidence that blacks trust police at least as much as whites do .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The poll results are hardly surprising .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A new Gallup poll confirms blacks place less confidence in police and the criminal justice system .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Using survey data from 2006 through 2014 , Gallup found :.  * 31 percentage points more blacks than whites believe black males are more likely to go to prison than white males primarily because of discrimination (50 percent versus 19 percent) .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*7 percentage points more blacks believe the honesty and ethics of police are low/very low (17 percent versus 10 percent) .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similarly ,  a 2013 Pew Research Centersurvey reveals that 70 percent of blacks believed police treated whites better than blacks .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By contrast, only 37 percent of whites agreed .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But what people say and what they do are often different .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And there are both victims and criminals in black communities .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Victims may trust the police for the same reasons that criminals dislike them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blacks are not a monolithic group: blacks who who have been through the criminal justice system as criminals could answer these questions quite differently than those who have relied on police as victims .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The polls don't distinguish between these two groups .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Charles Barkley recently said : ""[Police] are the only thing in the ghetto between this place being the wild, wild west.""  Most violent crime victims don't report crimes to police .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example ,  only about half of rapes are reported to police .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That has a lot to do with how victims believe they will be treated by the police .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the case of rape, victims who think that the police are unsympathetic to rape victims or are unlikely to solve the cases are even less likely to report rapes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If black victims really believe police are racist , why would they report the crime to the police? Blacks victims don't want other blacks locked up simply due to their race ; they want the criminals who actually committed the crime punished .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course people are more likely to report crimes to police if they believe the police will solve them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why waste time filling out forms and being interviewed if the crime isn't going to be solved? If blacks think police are incompetent or dishonest or just don't care , again there is little reason to turn to the police for help .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  blacks don't shy away from reporting crimes to the police .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statisticsfrom 2008 to 2012 shows that blacks are actually more likely than whites to report violent crimes to the police -- 9 percentage points more likely than whites (54 percent to 45 percent) .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blacks consistently report violent crimes at a higher rate than whites do .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That applies to all income groups as well as for victims living in urban and suburban areas .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This higher rate of reporting is true in areas where blacks face higher violent crime rates than whites and also when the reverse is true .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that whites who are below 200 percent of the poverty level face a higher violent crime rate than blacks with the same income , yet blacks still report those crimes at a higher rate .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For incomes above 200 percent of poverty, blacks are more frequent victims of violent crime , but again they are still more likely to report them .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On average, blacks are victims of violent crime at much higher rates than whites , but the gap isn't as large as many people think .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Typically, crime rate comparisons are in terms of the FBI crime data -- data relying on the number of crimes reported to police .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But , as we have just noted , that is misleading , because blacks report violent crimes at higher rates .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While the FBI crime numbers show blacks to have a 40 percent higher violent crime rate , the actual difference is about 30 percent .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When it comes to crime , the demonstrations and pundits don't reflect how most blacks feel most of the time .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There appears to be a silent majority of blacks who trust the police .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many blacks may get angry about particular cases in the news , but when they have to turn to someone for help , they turn to the police .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blacks apparently trust the police to do their job more frequently than whites do .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In 2013, the assault rate for the general public in the United States was 229 per 100,000 people .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the rate police were assaulted that year was 9,300 per 100,000 officers - a rate 41 times higher .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The only reason that police don't die at as high of a rate as people in other professions is because of their training and the fact that they are armed .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Would you consider it ""dangerous"" to live in Detroit? After all ,  it has by far the highest assault rate in the country, at 1,257 per 100,000 people .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But police are still 7.4 times more likely to be assaulted (=9,300/1,257) .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aggravated assaults don't necessarily involve injuries, just the attempt to cause serious bodily injury , but police are injured at a very high rate - 2,700 per 100,000 police officer .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is still much higher than the total assault data for civilians .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This data also suggests that police are not actively looking for excuses to fire their weapons .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"No matter whose side you are on in the upheaval following the killing of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri , everyone should agree on the profound sadness of it all: sadness that an 18-year-old boy-man walked a path that led to his destruction ; sadness that a police officer felt the need to defend himself by shooting another human being ; sadness over the rioting and looting that followed a grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Wilson ; and for some, sadness that Wilson was not indicted .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Much of the sadness was encapsulated in a sound bite I saw on one TV network .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An African-American business owner, surveying the destruction of his store, plaintively asked , ""How am I going to feed my kids?""  I have an answer and it is one that should be applied to anyone convicted of riotous behavior, destruction of property and looting .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's called restitution .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Restitution is an Old Testament concept instituted to remind people that when one harms another person, or steals or destroys property , someone else suffers and deserves reimbursement .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It says the state is less a debtor than the victim of a crime .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Restitution can also instill true moral guilt in a person , which can lead to genuine repentance and a decision by the perpetrator to make different choices leading to a better life .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the authorities in Ferguson examine videos that show the faces of many of the rioters and looters , charges will undoubtedly be filed .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If convicted , the perpetrators should be forced to pay for the damage they caused .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If they have jobs , their paychecks should be garnished .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If they are on welfare , those checks should be forwarded to the businesses they destroyed .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If they receive food-purchasing assistance , that assistance should be withdrawn .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This should be the practice going forward .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Those who destroy their communities will be required to pay back those harmed by their hooliganism and forfeit any government benefits they receive .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This might require legislation , but politicians should have the public's support .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A close relative of restitution is shaming .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The convicted should be brought before those harmed by their behavior and publicly shamed .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No one seems to be ashamed of anything nowadays , but shaming might help prevent future violence .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rioters and looters who are black could be shamed by law-abiding African-Americans .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They can be asked , ""Is this why Dr  Martin Luther King Jr  marched and went to prison? Is this why he paid the ultimate price? Would he and other civil rights leaders dating back to Frederick Douglass be proud of your behavior today? Don't you owe them something better than this?""  Perhaps if people realize that their destructive behavior will cost them something , they think might twice about harming others and robbing them of a living .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People from around the country are reportedly donating money to help those whose businesses were destroyed .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That again demonstrates the generosity of Americans of all races and backgrounds .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While donations will help, along with insurance , if it covers damage caused by violent protesters , the lawbreakers should still be required to take responsibility for their actions .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to whatever legal penalties might result , restitution and shaming should be part of the punishment .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We've gotten away from personal responsibility and accountability , preferring instead to cast lawbreakers as ""victims,"" when the true victims are often ignored .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too often many blame others for their circumstances .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Fed enjoyed some success boosting U.S  growth , but here are five reasons why QE won't work for the ECB .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 \. Eurozone Is Not a Country .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The European Union does not have a large budget and issues few euro-denominated bonds the ECB could purchase .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead ,  the ECB will have to purchase individual country debt -- it is as if the Fed had to purchase a basket of bonds issued by California, Iowa and other states .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Markets for European bonds--both sovereign and corporate--and bank lending are highly fragmented along country lines .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Consequently ,  it is unlikely that QE will have much effect on banks' willingness to make new business loans in places buffeted by the financial crisis, like Spain and Greece .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 \. EU Has No Fannie Mae .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
QE seems to work best when central banks inject capital directly into specific markets .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Fed purchased mortgage-backed securities that significantly lowered interest rates on mortgages across America .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Housing prices recovered much of the value lost during the financial crisis , and new home construction rebounded .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The EU has no analog to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and the ECB cannot readily purchase mortgage-backed securities to boost the European housing sector .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 \. Fiscal Policy Is Pulling in the Opposite Direction .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Europe's largest economy, Germany, recently accomplished a balanced budget for the first time since 1969 , and austerity programs intended to restore solvency have forced massive government spending cuts and tax increases in Spain, Greece and other Mediterranean states .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Those spending cuts -- though essential to sorely needed structural reforms -- will undercut the effects of any increased bank lending ECB bond purchase may induce .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With unemployment hovering at about 25 percent in Spain and Greece, and 13 percent in Italy, banks will remain skeptical that lending to expand businesses will do much to create bigger markets for what they sell .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 \. QE Does Little to Fix Euro-Imposed Dysfunctions .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although structural reforms could make Greece , Italy and other high unemployment economies more attractive places to build factories and establish businesses in the long run, governments in Athens, Rome and other capitals face voters who need jobs now .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the cost of labor--though perhaps gradually falling--in these countries will remain too high to attract investment for many years .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If Mediterranean countries still had their own currencies , those could let their currencies fall in value relative to those of northern European states .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That would re-price labor to attract investment and jobs .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the single currency, the euro, deprives them of that lever .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 \. Absence of Pan European Institutions .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Though the Europeans have a single currency , they lack common education standards and language that gives the United States a more or less single labor market .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the absence of currency devaluation to re-price Mediterranean labor, Greeks, Italians and Spaniards cannot migrate to Germany where unemployment is only 5 percent, with the same ease that Americans have migrated to South Dakota and Texas to participate in the oil boom .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the end, the EU and ECB lacks what the Fed enjoys--the punch of a national government that ran large deficits to augment its efforts to pull the U.S  economy out of recession and national credit, housing and labor markets that made monetary policies--like QE--reasonably effective .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the end, the EU and ECB lacks what the Fed enjoys--the punch of a national government that ran large deficits to augment its efforts to pull the U.S  economy out of recession and national credit, housing and labor markets that made monetary policies--like QE--reasonably effective .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In his half century reign of terror, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro committed manifold atrocities .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Documented evidence reveals him to be a ruthless tyrant who endlessly abused the most basic of human rights -a man who played a pivotal role in bringing the world to the precipice of nuclear annihilation for 13 harrowing days in October of 1962 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beyond his crimes against humanity and the callous suffering he inflicted on the people of Cuba , he ruined the lives and livelihoods of thousands of Americans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He stole their land, homes, bank accounts, possessions and businesses .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He absconded with their property under the guise of ""nationalization."" But he is, in truth, a thief .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will his victims now be fairly compensated or otherwise see the return of their confiscated property in the wake of America's first steps toward rapprochement with Cuba? The answer is both legal and political .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
President Obama holds the key .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, don't get your hopes up .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Theft .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the first half of the 20th century, Americans and U.S  businesses dominated Cuba .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They accumulated vast holdings of property and operated many of the most lucrative businesses .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of that ended with the Cuban Revolution in 1959 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Castro ""nationalized"" U.S.-owned industries and seized much of the island's private property from Americans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was no restitution .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One legal scholar called it the largest uncompensated expropriation by a foreign government in history .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The U.S  retaliated with an embargo , prohibiting all trade .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the Americans who were expelled from Cuba were left holding titles and deeds to homes and businesses to which they had no access .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Their property rights were dissolved , and any legal judgments obtained were unenforceable against an isolated nation that refused to recognize any authority other than its own .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thousands pursued legal recourse and sought reparations under indemnification programs established by Congress .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Others filed lawsuits and secured judgments .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But Castro didn't care .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He repudiated the legitimacy of the restitution programs, the valuation of losses and the legal authority of the courts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This , even though Cuba admits their renegade nationalization was, and is , compensable .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So what , then ,  does Castro consider fair compensation? Judging from his payouts to other aggrieved nations , it is mere pennies on the dollar .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How do you value dirt?  In 1961, the U.S  Commerce Department valued American property seized by the Cuban government at roughly $ 1 to 1.8 billion .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nearly 6-thousand claims were legally certified .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other published reports placed the theft as high as $ 9 billion .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the truth is , it's impossible to know -especially inasmuch as the value of everything plummeted the moment Castro took control of the island .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What would the same confiscated properties be worth in today's dollars? $50 billion? $100 billion? How about nothing at all? Given how the Castro brothers have driven their economy into the ground , making Cuba one of the poorest nations in the world , valuation could be closer to dirt than dollars .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Which invites another question : assuming a monetary value could somehow be devised , how would Cuba pay for it? With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Castros lost their financial benefactor .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The island is blighted and broke .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even if it offered government bonds as compensation , are they worth the paper upon which they are written? How could they be secured?  Reclaim the property?  Theoretically, it is possible for the confiscated property to be reclaimed someday by the original owners .",par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But that would require a dramatic Cuban transformation from socialism to democracy where private property ownership is permitted .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a recent speech, Cuban President Raul Castro insisted Cuba would not renounces its core socialist ideals as part of the deal he negotiated with President Obama to renew diplomatic relations .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even if some semblance of democracy were to be restored to Cuba in the distant future , what remains of the stolen property? No one knows how many of the private residences that were seized have been divided or fallen into decay .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some may no longer exist .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And what of the current occupants? Would they allow themselves to be kicked out?  The same may be true of the many farms, industries and commercial businesses that were confiscated and have been put to other uses in the last 5 decades .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, they have development potential in an open, free market society .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But ,  again, the future of Cuba is nebulous .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How realistic is the return of these vast holdings under a continuing Castro regime?  What Obama should do .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a first condition to normalizing relations, President Obama should demand that all American victims of stolen property be compensated equitably .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He is already obligated by law to do this under the Helms-Burton Act .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But Obama has a propensity to ignore or overrule with impunity those laws he regards as misguided or inconvenient .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is one law he should follow .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A second condition should be the establishment of a commission of judges with legally binding authority to render compensation decisions .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Several reparation models can be studied and replicated, notably the tribunal that dispensed claims in post-unification Germany .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
President Obama has the power and leverage to force the Castro regime to capitulate if Cuba wants to end the sanctions and restore economic relations .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But so far, he has uttered not a word about a desire to do so .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And when it comes to negotiations with adversaries , Obama tends to give away the store .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let's agree for the sake of argument that this recent warming was partly caused by humanity .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let's also agree that there are some negative effects, including more frequent coastal flooding or longer droughts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wish climate alarmists would weigh its accomplishments against the relatively small downsides of climate change .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of industry's biggest accomplishments is creating a world where far fewer of us are likely to die because of weather .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alex Epstein's book ""The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels"" documents the rapidly shrinking number of human beings killed by storms, floods and other climate events thanks largely to ever-growing industry, fueled mainly by oil, natural gas and coal .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On ""Stossel"" my Fox Business Network TV show this week , he argues that if we compare conditions a century ago to conditions last year , we shouldn't obsess about how much carbon dioxide is in the air -- or whether Earth is warming -- we should look at how much safer life became .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2013, ""Climate-related deaths were at a record low  -- in supposedly the worst climate in history -- under 30,000,"" says Epstein .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1931, bad weather killed 3 million people .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You can argue that we get some things wrong as a civilization , but thanks to our use of fossil fuels, we get something very right .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Epstein points out that humanity owes its current ability to survive harsh winters, arid deserts and other naturally -dangerous environments to the same fuels that activists now condemn : ""We have the luxury of being able to absorb a certain amount of climate-related damage so we can live in all of these cool places.""  His argument is unusual because environmentalists spread the idea that, without human interference, the planet is perfect .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But by what standard?  ""If you went to someone 300 years ago and asked them , do you have a perfect climate?"" they would think you were crazy , says Epstein .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""They were terrified of climate , because climate doesn't give you the resources that you need . It doesn't give you water when you need it . It doesn't give you the temperature when you need it.""  It was once common to say that humans change their environment .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That shouldn't offend people today , says Epstein .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We should be thrilled that humans ""create technology to master climate . ... That's why so few people today die from climate.""  Epstein correctly says that instead of talking about ""climate change""  -- of which there will always be some, with or without human influence -- we should focus on ""climate catastrophe,"" weather that actually kills people .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Those catastrophes, measured in lost lives, are getting rarer .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of the changes humans make to our environment are desirable changes that help us live longer and more comfortably .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The dogma that man is ruining the planet rather than improving it is a religion, a source of prestige and a career for too many people.""  If we regard nature as pristine and think it must never be altered , we will have big problems .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I think of industry as something that is mostly very good for us, with a few minor side effects that aren't .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only 10 percent thought the president had had a positive impact on relations - 8 percent of whites and 17 percent of blacks .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is an impressive underachievement from our first African-American president .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall ,  78 percent of respondents , when asked about ""race relations in your community,"" said they were ""generally good."" That included 82 percent of whites and 73 percent of blacks -- a strong vote of confidence, especially from a group that was much less positive about the country as a whole, with only 47 percent saying U.S  race relations were ""generally good.""  This split suggests that people have absorbed the narrative that our country has a race problem not from their personal experience in their own communities, but from the media or our political leaders .",par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most compelling aspect of that story line entails racial bias in law enforcement .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many initiatives, from decriminalizing marijuana possession to de-emphasizing tactics like ""stop and frisk,"" have been promulgated based on the fact that more blacks than whites end up on the wrong side of the law .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Most important, perhaps, is that the declines were recorded not just for whites, but for all races .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2002, 173,000 African-Americans reported a ""use of force""; in 2011 , that was down to 130,000 .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Immigration is a remarkably complex subject, and not just as a matter of policy .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our nation's immigration laws can be difficult to understand .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our Constitution, however, isn't complicated .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our system of government is simple .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Congress writes the law , the president executes the law , and the judiciary interprets the law .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The president does not make new law .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That concept is called the ""separation of powers,"" and it's of core importance to our democracy .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a bulwark against tyranny, our Founders determined that no single branch of government could perform all the functions of government -- making, enforcing, and interpreting the law .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In other words ,  our Founders took the classic powers of a king and divided them between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For our government to work , those functions must remain separate .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But President Obama disagrees with the Founders .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In his view, apparently, government is only truly ""working"" when he gets the policies he wants .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When he doesn't , he calls that ""obstructionism"" and gets busy finding workarounds to democracy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While presidents do have a degree of discretion in determining exactly how to enforce the law , President Obama's immigration actions go far, far beyond that lawful discretion and veer directly into lawmaking, the exclusive role of the legislature .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Here's how :.  President Obama is taking action in direct defiance to Congress's ""expressed or implied intent,"" and that means his power--constitutionally--is at its ""lowest ebb.""  Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, in the seminal case of Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co  v  Sawyer, outlined an influential three-part test for executive action .",other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's exactly what President Obama did .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Article I of the Constitution grants Congress -- not the president -- the power to ""establish a uniform Rule of Naturalizations,"" and Congress has acted under that power to write and pass a comprehensive set of immigration statutes .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many people disagree with those laws -- and President Obama is particularly dissatisfied -- but they are still the law .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And the president certainly can't hide behind ""prosecutorial discretion."" The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) --the government lawyers President Obama asked to evaluate his proposed program -- were clear , declaring that the president cannot ""under the guise of exercising enforcement discretion, attempt to effectively rewrite the laws to match its policy preference.""  Thus , as the Secretary of Homeland Security said , ""As an act of prosecutorial discretion, deferred action is legally available so long as it is granted on a case-by-case basis , and it may be terminated at any time at the agency's discretion.""  But did President Obama promise a ""case-by-case"" determination , or did he make a sweeping promise to millions of illegal immigrants? He didn't promise them a careful review , he promised them a deal .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Here are his words :.  So we're going to offer the following deal : If you've with been in America more than five years . If you have children who are American citizens or illegal residents . If you register, pass a criminal background check and you're willing to pay your fair share of taxes , you'll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation . You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law . That's what this deal is .",other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I am examining the ""deal"" President Obama offers and compare it with the requirements of the law -- the requirement of a case-by-case review .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ""deal"" does not match the law .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Put simply , if President Obama is enacting the ""case-by-case"" review mandated by the OLC memo , he is misleading the four million illegal aliens he encouraged to come ""out of the shadows."" If he is defying the attorneys at the OLC and giving illegal aliens the ""deal"" he promised , then he is misleading the American public .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No one disputes that our nation faces an immigration challenge .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We truly are a nation of immigrants .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am the grandson of a Russian immigrant .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But that reform must be done lawfully and in accordance with the Constitution .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bottom line : impatient presidents may not violate the Constitution if they don't get their way .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expected congressional vote on a new sanctions bill against the Iranian regime has rekindled debate over Tehran's nuclear defiance and the best way to confront it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Congress has misgivings about a rogue regime intent on obtaining nuclear capability , and understandably wants to ensure that Washington does not strike a bad deal .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some argue that a decisive approach toward Tehran will be counterproductive .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But their position ignores historical lessons and stands on a number of myths that need to be debunked .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Myth #1 : More sanctions on Iran will prompt the regime to unilaterally walk away from the talks .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran cannot afford to walk away because it is desperate and vulnerable .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It has a genuine interest to secure the lifting of existing sanctions , which provided the initial impetus for the regime to talk .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then ,  too, cynics argued that sanctions would prompt Tehran to accelerate its nuclear activities .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The regime is playing a game of attrition, aiming to weaken U.S  resolve, win more concessions, and maintain its nuclear infrastructure .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bipartisan sanctions bill will force Tehran to consider speedy compliance .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reiterated , ""Breaking the anti- Iran sanctions is the only way to achieve national progress,"" acknowledging that Iran's devastated economy cannot endure the weight of further sanctions, especially after the recent decline in oil prices .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The mullahs are paranoid of a disenchanted population already on edge .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With rampant unemployment, inflation, and loss of oil revenues , walking away from the talks is not an option , especially if a sanctions-in-waiting bill is hovering over their head .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Myth #2 : With more sanctions, Tehran will blame Washington for sabotaging diplomacy , and start on the path towards war .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even with slumping oil revenues  - slashed by at least 45 % - the official defense budget has jumped 30 %, mostly allocated to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And , more money is being funneled into Syria and Iraq to execute Tehran's designs - a budget that is twice that of all the country's publically funded universities combined .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If sanctions fail to force Tehran to abandon key parts of its nuclear program after over a year of negotiations , then continued talks with no additional leverage will fail as well .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The IAEA still has no access to suspect nuclear sites and its questions remain unanswered .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said in November 2014, ""Iran has not provided any explanations that enable the Agency to clarify the outstanding practical measures , nor has it proposed any new practical measures in the next step of the Framework for Cooperation, despite several requests from the Agency.""  Senior U.S  officials have repeatedly stated that even without additional sanctions the chances for reaching an agreement with Iran is less that 50 percent .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So , as Iran tries to wear out western negotiators , clearly, additional leverage from Congress is necessary, not counterproductive .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Myth #3 : New sanctions will strengthen ""hardliners"" in Iran who want to sabotage a prospective deal .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is perhaps the most enduring myth in Washington that has dangerously infected Iran policy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The idea that there are moderate elements in Iran's body politic , and the U.S  needs to reach out to them by making more concessions is ludicrous .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The oft-cited dichotomy between ""hardliners"" and ""moderates"" in Iran badly misrepresents a system whose elements are united in their strategic objectives .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rouhani , himself a longtime confidant of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , was instructed by the latter to sign onto the Joint Plan of Action in November 2013 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Foreign Minister Zarif told the Iranian Parliament earlier this month that he has the full trust of Khamenei to continue the negotiations .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Experience has shown that diplomacy without leverage has never worked with dictators, especially in Tehran .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This puts Congress on the right path .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sanctions bill can be a game- changer .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It will strengthen Washington's hand while helping to peacefully arrest Tehran's advance towards the bomb .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He is simply trying to be accurate .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He explains (and I paraphrase) that the Paris assassins were just folks who happened to commit mass murder against some journalists (every spokesman's fantasy -- I speak from personal experience) and then ,  stuck for an explanation, invoked Islam .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The proof that this had nothing to do with the Religion of Peace is that it was ""roundly condemned by (unnamed) Muslim spiritual leaders .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not since the hapless Ron Ziegler assured the press that his boss, Richard Nixon, was not a crook , has a White House spokesman been reduced to invoking the , ""who-are-you-going- to- believe, me-or-your-lying-eyes,"" defense in quite such a pitiful way .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The name ""Josh Earnest"" may not go down in history , but it is destined to become a ""Jeopardy"" answer : What presidential spokesman denied the existence of Islamic terrorism?  Of course Earnest did this in a good cause -- keeping his job .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And to be charitable , his boss probably has virtuous reasons for his see-no-evil approach , For one thing ,  he doesn't want to insult American Muslims , who are his supporters .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For another, he may imagine that he is protecting them from Tea Party pogroms, an abiding, if entirely imaginary, liberal concern .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is likely that Obama also thinks that his discreet silence about who did what to whom in Paris is a boon the American fight for hearts and minds in the Middle East .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"For two years, Obama and Secretary of State Kerry have relentlessly and futilely tried to convince Jerusalem to withdraw from the West Bank and agree to the creation of a Palestinian state .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The plan has been on life support for months ; it died--at least for the duration of the Obama administration -- in the kosher supermarket where four Jews were shot dead by a gunman inspired by the (non-denominational!) Islamic Caliphate of Iraq and Syria .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A.A  has succeeded because it was the first to say , ""Stop drinking FIRST and then we'll work on your problems."" Thanks to this subtle shift, countless jobs, marriages, and even lives have been saved .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Heretofore, humanity's approach to peace has been like outdated approaches to alcoholism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Attempts at peace have centered on , ""Let's resolve our differences so we can stop killing each other."" This has only lead to the discovery of more differences and more killing .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's time we followed the example of recovery programs such as A.A  and resolve to, FIRST, stop killing each other and then we can work on our differences .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
War is used as a tool of international policy because people accept it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All we have to do is change our minds -- to cease to believe that war is an acceptable necessary evil and to begin to believe that no disagreement is worth killing each other's children .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Countries have been trying to resolve their differences so that there will no longer be war .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We need to declare peace first and then spend eternity working out our differences .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The option of war is simply removed from the table .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is why I am declaring enduring world peace beginning September 21, 2056 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seriously .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
September 21st is the United Nations World Day of Peace -- so there is already momentum there .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We just need to turn those national celebrations into a countdown to world peace .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2056 is far enough in the future that it gives us time for enough people to make the requisite shift in belief such that peace will, indeed, reign on planet Earth .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Who am I to make such a proclamation? I'm just a writer and an ordained minister and there are crazy preachers who, every decade or so, declare the end of the world is coming on this or that date .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So why can't I say when world peace will begin?  Incidentally, this is not a new idea .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Kellogg Briand Pact of 1927, sponsored by the United States and signed by 62 countries declared that war may not be used to resolve ""disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be , which may arise.""  Every major religion shares a common belief in the sanctity of human life and yet war has endured .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If enough people believe -- just believe , that as of September 21, 2056 war will end on planet earth -- it must happen!  If eleven, only eleven out of 196 countries are at peace , it still means that right now, in at least eleven countries there is peace .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We simply need to build on this over the next forty-two years .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jeb Bush announced Tuesday morning that he has set up an exploratory committee to pursue running for president .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Virtually every person who takes this step ultimately throws his or her hat in the ring .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's only a matter of time .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How should we assess Jeb Bush's candidacy?  Polls show him at or near the top of the prospective Republican nominees for 2016 .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The recent McClatchy-Marist poll has Mitt Romney and Bush leading with 19 and 15 percent respectively .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And a PPP poll has Bush ahead of Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Paul Ryan and both Rand Paul and Ted Cruz .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite this, Bush by no means has an insurmountable lead .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And while the Bush name for some is a positive and will help Jeb enormously, for others it is an unalterable negative both because of prior history, ideology and perceived performance in office .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That said , there is one constituency that I fully expect to support Jeb Bush: the donors, bundlers and those who pursue independent expenditure .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There' s every reason to believe that this community - the money community - will rally behind Bush's candidacy and given the importance of independent expenditure political action committees in the last presidential election, it's fair to assume that between his own campaign committee and outsiders , he will be the best funded candidate in the Republican field .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nevertheless ,  it will be far from a cakewalk for Bush in the primary .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His problems are three fold .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  his ardent support for Common Core does not sit well with many in his party .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second ,  he has come out in support of comprehensive immigration reform, a hot button issue today with the GOP and its supporters, especially in light of President Obama's executive action last month .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And third, he's considered tax increases as part of an overall reform package to help balance the budget in the past - anathema to those that control the GOP today .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For all these reasons, it may be hard for Tea Party Republicans and the right wing of the party more generally , to support his candidacy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not to say that Jeb Bush will not be smart enough to try to neutralize these potential disadvantages .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He surely will .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To this end, Bush's thoughtful and reasonable message at the Wall Street CEOs conference was a positive and uplifting one , exactly what the Republican Party needs to go mainstream and what the Tea Party itself abhors .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Should Bush make the general election he will be a compelling candidate against the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The most recent poll numbers show the race between them tightening , and I suspect the campaign itself will reflect that reality .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Put another way , both Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton represent the center of their parties and both are practical politicians , if nothing else .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They're both also smart and serious about the issues and we can expect , if they're the nominees , to have a thoughtful debate about America's future with the possibility of candidate agreement on a number of issues, something we haven't seen in decades .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know Jeb Bush and I know Hillary Clinton .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They are both considerate people, committed to the broader interests of the American people regardless of political party .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jeb Bush's entry into the race prospectively gives the Republicans their strongest candidate and possible nominee .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It also gives the American people the prospect of the best debate and dialogue we've had in a very long time .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Welcome, Jeb .",no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The blast brutally kills and cripples its victims .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most nearby dive for cover .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's what the American media have been doing for decades .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Every time another Muslim terrorist beheads, butchers or bombs, journalists do their best to hide from the reality .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Or quickly cover up the result as if they believe the rest of us will soon forget .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Recent terror attacks in the United States, Canada, Australia and Israel (journalists love to skip them) haven't stopped the short-term memory wipe .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On Monday evening and Tuesday morning, ABC, CBS and NBC left out the Islamic connection from the trial of alleged Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terrorists attacked the magazine Charlie Hebdo 24 hours later .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not the Islamic monsters who did the attack .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remember the media reaction to the riots over Danish cartoons depicting Mohammad in 2005 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two hundred people died in global riots .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even now, the newspaper that published the cartoons must boost security .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it wasn't just whether to run the images .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was the rationale .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The New York Times didn't publish the cartoons , calling them ""no less hurtful to most Muslims than Nazi caricatures of Jews or Ku Klux Klan caricatures of blacks are to those victims of intolerance."" ""That is why the Danish cartoons will not be reproduced on these pages,"" it wrote .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the wake of the latest attack the Times used Twitter to blame the victims saying ""#CharlieHebdo has long tested limits with its satire."" Financial Times associate editor Tony Barber, soon after the attack, blamed the magazine for having ""a long record of mocking, baiting and needling French Muslims."" I didn't know ""needling"" warranted the death penalty .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"USA Today responded with the dangerous rantings of Anjem Choudary, ""a radical Muslim cleric,"" who also criticized the cartoonists .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Islam does not mean peace but rather means submission to the commands of Allah alone,"" he admitted .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Free people aren't surprised .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He added , ""Muslims do not believe in the concept of freedom of expression.""  That anti-freedom argument is what news outlets are surrendering to .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But they are hardly the only cowardly media involved .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hollywood has been running scared from radical Islam for years - far worse than how it handled North Korea .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When Tom Clancy's ""Sum of All Fears"" hit the big screen , the terrorists who nuke an American city were no longer dangerous Islamists as they were in the book .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Evil Russians were ""far more acceptable both to Hollywood sensibilities and the Arab ethnic lobby,"" reported Slate .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hollywood bowed to the Muslim pressure group the Council on American-Islamic Relations .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ABC Family killed ""controversial"" ""Alice in Arabia"" rather than offend Muslims .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The TV show ""South Park"" depicted Mohammed in a bear suit in one episode , to avoid showing an actual image .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The writers still received death threats .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Comedy Central killed the next episode before Islamists did the same to its staff .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two Muslim converts were convicted in the case .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A Facebook protest of the ""South Park"" fiasco called ""Everybody Draw Mohammed Day"" resulted in more threats .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Artist Molly Norris ended up ""moving, changing her name and essentially wiping away her identity,"" according to The Seattle Weekly .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even a Yale University Press book about the Danish cartoon controversy wouldn't include the images that were the subject matter of the book ""because the University and the Press are concerned about a possible resurgence of violence,"" wrote The Yale Daily News .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then why do the book at all?  Journalists labeled those criticizing Islam ""phobes,"" rather than blame Muslims .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Time ran a cover story asking ""Is America Islamophobic?"" with the preconceived answer that ""hate speech against Muslims and Islam is growing both more widespread and more heated.""  It's all part of how media and the left redefine reality .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Terrorists"" become ""militants"" and ""terrorism"" becomes ""workplace violence."" All to hide reality .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This weekend millions of Americans will take to the mall to get last-minute gifts for their loved ones .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They will pour through the already-picked-over selections to try and find ""the gift."" For those of you who are forced into the mall this weekend : I'm sorry .",other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Here are five things to avoid as we enter the final shopping days before Christmas .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 \. Believe the best bargains are found if you wait until the last minute .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While it's true , retailers are starting their after-Christmas sales earlier than ever - just as the Christmas shopping season starts before you get to Thanksgiving dessert - seasoned shoppers know (1) value and (2) bargain do not mean the same thing .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We all know just because something is cheap doesn't mean it's ""a bargain"" or a ""value."" It's only a bargain if it is truly something you want or need , and are able to get it at a deep discount .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Often last minute shoppers don't know what they want .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For those shopping this weekend you will have to settle for what circumstances present , which in many cases will be cheap materials, but not a bargains .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The value is the ratio of quality (or quantity) to price .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Low quality at a low price is no value , especially when compared to high quality at a low price .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Values tend go early in the holiday shopping season .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cheap stays on the shelf until it's all that's left .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Believe there is still money to spend in your budget this month .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last minute shopping, particularly for December, means buying during the back half of the month .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's typically when most income for the month is already committed , and any incremental spending means ""borrowing against the future."" It's better to buy early - and spread the purchasing over time  - so you can more easily absorb the expense .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nobody likes that ""January surprise."" And for new last- minute shoppers, that surprise can be surprisingly BIG! 3 .",no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Believe you can still find ""just the right gift for Uncle George."" Waiting until the last minute to shop means having to make compromises .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Time and selection are your two greatest ""friends"" when you shop early .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But for last minute shoppers they become your two greatest nightmares : you're pressed for time and all the best colors, sizes and values, are gone .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't put yourself under a lot of pressure to find that perfect gift .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At this stage in the game, a gift will do .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Believe you still need ""just one more"" gift .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We should all take a lesson out of Santa's playbook: 1 . Make a list . 2 . Check it twice .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too often last minute shopping isn't just an indication you've waited to the bitter end to buy those needed gifts .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It also means you've waited too long to plan that shopping .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And when that happens you're never quite sure if you have all the gifts you need (it seems keeping track of what you've bought is just as hard as planning what to buy in advance!) .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So you keep buying just one more gift ... just to make sure you've covered all your bases .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By the way, that's when shoppers are especially susceptible to impulse buying .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An attention-arresting display will attract last minute shoppers like honey attracts flies! 5 .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Believe that the shopper has the advantage .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While it is true that the Saturday before Christmas is still one of the busiest shopping days of the year , the advantage has swung back in favor of the retailer .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With fewer hours to shop until Santa fills his sack , the retailer has the upper hand , especially if they've had a strong Q4 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For some , shopping the weekend before Christmas can bring the ultimate sense of that holiday experience .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For those who enjoy shopping as a pastime , it's one of the best times to be in the mall , but for those folks who need to fulfill a shopping list , it can be one of the worst .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The early bird still does get the worm .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And the late bird gets  ... the opportunity to pick over the dregs with a lot of other ""late birds."" With the brief time remaining before Christmas, use it to ""shop for fun"" not for necessity .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It will truly help keep you in the Christmas spirit .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It will truly help keep you in the Christmas spirit .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Can you banish the labels ""date rape,"" ""victims"" and ""poor people"" from your vocabulary in 2015? Labels can diminish and demean or to uplift and affirm people .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015 will be a year of hope and dignity by redefining or banishing these toxic and harmful labels .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In their place a more generous, positive and compassionate country will emerge .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Here's why a deeper look at these three labels :.  Date Rape .,par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the most commonly talked about fear on college campuses across the country .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2014 was filled with stories of sexual abuse from the ranks of the NFL and their spouses to the iconic Bill Cosby .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On college campuses date rape involves issues of consent and sobriety; of women who feel that they don't have the ability to consent or not ; of alcohol and drugs like ""roofies"" used as excuses and no specific profile of the typical rapist .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The words date and rape should never be accepted as co-joined words .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My friend Tony Porter of A Call to Men says that gender based violence will only end when men address it and reassess what it means to be a man .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He is correct .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To be on a date is to enter into an exploration of romance, companionship and possibly love .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is about exploring the possibilities of human togetherness and relationship .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rape is a criminal and violent exercise of abuse and power .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To disassociate these two words - rape and date  - is to redefine the expectation of healthy and also criminal behavior .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can redefine the term date rape by celebrating the possibilities of healthy dating and mincing no words about the criminality of rape .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Engaging young men in the cause of stopping gender based violence will bring with it lasting impact on healthy relationships .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Victims .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The accusers of sexual violence are commonly called victims .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are typically the victims of aggressive non-consensual sex .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But to call them victims is to deny their courage and strength .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The supermodel Janice Dickinson recently said that she is not an accuser .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She explained this by saying that she is speaking her truth about what Bill Cosby did to her decades ago .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How strong do you have to be to speak out against those who are iconic figures or heroes - whether clergy, Cosby or NFL players?  To speak your truth against power typically results from years if not decades of inner work along with courage that reveals you have come to love yourself enough to not be intimidated by the powerful iconic figures who have committed sexual abuse .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"People like Dickinson are empowered, courageous victims .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They give hope to others including the many men who feel that their manhood will be compromised if they speak out against their male sexual abusers .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Empowered victims like Dickinson move us quickly from just feeling sorry to feeling admiration for their courageous empowerment .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What happened to them is criminal and to label them as just victims demeans their courage .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Empowered victims elevate their status and shine a bright spotlight on their heinous sexual aggressor .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poor People .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A pervasive new classism in the United States has emerged according to columnist David Brooks of the New York Times .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He posits that the meritocratic class view themselves as the respectable ones who have the ability to choose their own destiny .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They view the poor as lazy, disorganized, violent and scary .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In this view the poor are not proper human beings .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a dangerous construct that dehumanizes vast segments of our community .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've spent a lifetime working with and knowing people who are poor .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most work hard and often at several jobs ; like other human beings they yearn for the best for their children and families and have aspirations to live beyond poverty .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If the organization of the lives of those who are poor is different from that of the meritocratic class it is because of genetic roulette and the systems that often work to trap people in the mire of less opportunity .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brooks suggests that those who label the poor in this way live in a world that keeps them from knowing poor people .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The label begins to be redefined when you take time to know those who are different from you .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is up to you to make change in the New Year by not accepting these labels and then redefining them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You will be part of creating a more compassionate, generous and positive landscape .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A recent report , according to Reuters, finds that ""more than 3,000 students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill received credit for fake classes over an 18-year period as part of a program that allowed many of them to remain eligible to play sports.""  But college sports scandals, like the one at North Carolina, are missing the point .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We should not be focusing on how the university broke the rules of college sports for almost 20 years by sending thousands of athletes to no-show classes to keep players eligible for play .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We should not even be asking whether the University of South Carolina and several other NCAA schools should guarantee four-year, ""full cost of attendance"" scholarships .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The real question is far more basic : Why do so many colleges treat their star athletes better than their star students?  The comparison between how colleges treat athletes and high performing, low- income students is particularly revealing .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Student athletes are sought out ; once identified they are actively recruited ; admission comes with generous scholarships and once admitted students are pampered with better housing, free or subsidized food and special college counseling to help them adjust to college life .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"High performing, low-income students, in contrast, take out loans, engage in work-study programs and , once admitted , are left largely to fend for themselves .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We simply aren't doing enough to help academically gifted students who have financial need to offset the challenges of attending college .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First generation college goers , attending schools far away from home and family , are often quite fragile .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result, the smart-but-poor struggle .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Only 59% of children from low-income households scoring in the top quartile on standardized tests go on to graduate from a 4-year college , while 77% of children with similar scores but from wealthy families earn bachelor's degrees .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Worse, fully 17% of the top quartile of poor kids do not even apply to college .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recruited Tar Heel athletes have it far easier .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many factors contribute to this disparity , but one of the most significant obstacles preventing high-achieving, low-income students from attaining their full potential is they exist in isolation in high school .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They do their part in school but are held back because they aren't identified and given support and guidance they need .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is no football coach or athletic counselor for these kids ; they are on their own to develop a college selection strategy, navigate the maze of loan forms and develop a college budget .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ironically, the way big-time college athletes are recruited offers solutions to address this problem .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We should seek out talented students from poor backgrounds the way athletics coaches search for high school athletes .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Coaches know part of their job is to find and cultivate talent , so they send scouts to take in countless high school games looking for the next Tom Brady .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Admissions counselors often visit schools in wealthy suburbs , where most of the best students are college-bound anyway .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How often do they visit schools in impoverished areas looking for the next Sonia Sotomayor? What if colleges had academic scouts to scour science fairs, mathematics competitions, art shows, and school plays seeking out the super smart, highly-diligent, poor kid?  Star athletes are also celebrated by their local media and ranked in nationwide publications .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They go from small-town heroes to catching the attention of the best athletic programs in the country .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is nothing comparable for the smart kid .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are a long way from the revenge of the nerds .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Half the high schools in this country don't even have college counselors ; where they do exist , the quality provided is often abysmal -- either because the counselors have enormous caseloads or lack the resources and experience .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example , when I was Schools Chancellor , one New York high school had a single college counselor for 2,000 students .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Coaches also recruit by inviting potential applicants to make ""official visits"" paid for by the college , which can include transportation, daily meals, a room to stay in during visits, even entertainment expenses .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For many low-income, academically-gifted students, a paid college visit, especially one catered to their academic interests, is completely out of reach .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Until the recent initiative led by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the College Board, the application fee itself was a barrier .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do we really want to tell students that catching balls is more important than acing tests?  Consider NFL Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, for years an undiscovered talent .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He excelled but failed to gain attention from the best football programs like Ohio State or Oklahoma .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So he attended Mississippi Valley State University , where he was finally recognized and went on to have one of the best football careers of all time .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What if he had never picked up a ball? And what if today we fail to recognize academic talent in poor neighborhoods , never developing the whiz kids?  What if Albert Einstein had become an accountant or Neal DeGrasse Tyson a telephone repairman?  We do not need to end sports scholarships to address this issue , we just need to level the playing field .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By placing athletics ahead of academics , however ,  many colleges are making profoundly poor choices .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cost to our society of unrealized academic potential is unfathomable .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My organization was founded by a legendary sportsman, Jack Kent Cooke , who knew there was too much untapped potential in the nation's young people .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He left the bulk of a fortune from owning the Redskins to start the largest academic scholarship foundation in America -- to find low-income, exceptional students who beat the odds .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A fortune built on sports is dedicated to promoting academic stars .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My older brother was strung out on a number of drugs and I had moved in with him naively attempting to help my childhood hero .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One night he jumped on top of me, wrapped both hands around my throat and had all the rage in his eyes needed to end my life .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He sat in silence .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He didn't push me away or try to rush my journey with God .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The next few months were transformational, a religious love story .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like many in my generation, the faith I'd lost inside the four walls of a church was found again through believers who left the sanctuary to help people in need .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I hadn't been persuaded by a man building a congregation ; I was undone by a friend who listened without judgment .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These were the thoughts rattling around in my head when I heard the story of 10 churches in East Texas that had burned to the ground .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Right away I could see the makings of a great crime documentary akin to Errol Morris' ""The Thin Blue Line,"" but on a personal level, I also saw a road into my questions about churches .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ironically it was my brother who encouraged me to start making the film .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With his help I scraped together enough cash to cover airfare to Texas and a small camera crew .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then came a few more surprises .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As I interviewed pastors mourning the loss of their churches , I felt a growing sense of sympathy .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Far more than buildings, these people had lost their community homes -- places that heard wedding vows recited and last goodbyes whispered at funerals .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I began to feel sheepishly aware of my own cultural insensitivity .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After all ,  this was, as many locals put it, ""The buckle of the Bible belt.""  But the more I learned about the two young men who deliberately torched 10 houses of worship , the more I saw of myself .",par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"How precious in the sight of progressives was one of their saints, Mario Cuomo, the three-term governor of New York who died last week at age 82 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was a model of progressivism and a gifted rhetorician .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In most media accounts, references were made to two speeches Cuomo delivered in 1984, one at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco where Walter Mondale was nominated for president , and the other at the University of Notre Dame where Cuomo spoke about abortion and the ""proper"" role of religion in politics .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"After Democrats Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, Clinton and Obama , are fewer families in trouble? Are there fewer poor people, especially since Johnson's ""War on Poverty"" promised to end it?  Statistics reveal there are not , so why do so many embrace progressive ideas? If something isn't working , why repeat the errors?  As Reagan noted , government too often adds to problems ; it doesn' t solve them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Government doesn't create jobs ; a thriving private economy does .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Government welfare mostly doesn't incentivize people to escape poverty , but too often sustains them in poverty and addicts them to government handouts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Yes, the newly empowered Republicans in the Senate have the ability to control the floor and try to break through some of the gridlock and dysfunction associated with the failed tenure of now Minority Leader Harry Reid .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead of bottling up all the legislation that's been passed by the GOP House without ever letting it see the light of day , Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can start moving things forward with up or down votes and a full, fair and thorough amendment process .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am encouraged to see that the Keystone XL Pipeline is on the top of the docket .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This common-sense, environmentally sound project will not only create good-paying jobs for both unions and non-union members , it will also increase our domestic supply of oil, helping to keep prices low and more money in people's pockets , and it will help to reduce the influence of foreign governments .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's unfortunate that President Obama continues to impede progress on Keystone and is standing with the radical fringe of his party rather than the overwhelming majority of the country .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Likewise , now that the elections for leadership are over , House Speaker John Boehner needs to move immediately to unite his caucus and focus on the overwhelming areas of agreement within the GOP .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Above all ,  Republicans in Congress have to prove to the American people that they are responsible leaders who will put our country's interests first by being able to lead and get real results .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They need to show that they have learned from the mistakes of the past and will stop lurching from cliff to cliff and forcing self-imposed government shutdowns that only tarnish the GOP brand and make it harder to win future elections .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The new Republican Congress needs to make it impossible for the Democrats to falsely portray the Grand Old Party as a group of fire-breathing extremists focused on divisive social issues .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The simple reality is that even with a GOP Senate, there is only so much of President Obama's destructive agenda that we can work on repealing these next two years .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Visit a U.S  Department of Veterans Affairs facility and there' s a good chance you'll see a VA employee sporting a shiny lapel pin that reads ""ICARE.""  That's an acronym for ""Integrity, Commitment, Advocacy, Respect and Excellence,"" a list of words that represents the VA's ""core values."" As one of VA Secretary Bob McDonald's first orders of business, the ICARE pins were intended to signal a renewed commitment to service and honesty at the troubled VA .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During his confirmation in August, McDonald promised he would lead the push for ""unprecedented and critical cultural change and accountability"" at the VA .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead ,  five months later, most of what veterans have to show for it are watered-down reforms and a new slogan .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Or , as a few of our members put it : ""We pass historic VA reforms through Congress , and all we got was a lousy ICARE lapel pin.""  It's not enough to hire a slick PR firm to devise a catchy acronym that says you ""care"" ; what matters to veterans and their families is that you demonstrate your ""care"" through the results you deliver .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is why the ICARE lapel pins are such an affront to those of us who fought so hard for reform last year .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So how can veterans get the results we want to see at the VA in the new year? We need to continually press McDonald and his department to take a much more decisive approach to reform that gets to the real root of the problem : an entrenched and unaccountable bureaucracy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After all ,  it's much easier to put on an ICARE pin every morning than it is to shoulder the shame that too many VA executives should feel .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Make no mistake about it ; corrupt employees and a bloated bureaucracy are the problems that must be addressed -- and urgently .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To be fair to McDonald , there have been limited signs of progress at the VA, thanks to reforms passed by Congress that bring greater accountability and more patient choice to what is now the government's second-largest department .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example ,  Sharon Helman, the director of the VA's Phoenix Medical Center , which was ground zero for the secret waiting list scandal , was finally terminated in November  -- but only after more than 200 days of paid administrative leave .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A handful of other VA officials have also been forced out, but only after being given a chance to retire with benefits .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's a start, but not nearly adequate considering the depth and breadth of dysfunction .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
McDonald must keep up -- or preferably turn up -- the pressure in the year to come .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moreover ,  the VA needs to stop resisting the expansion of patient choice for veterans that Congress has mandated .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The department has been slow-walking the implementation of the reform law's provisions that would allow veterans who are facing a wait of more than 30 days to see a physician , or those who live far from VA facilities to consult with a medical provider in the private sector .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is an important measure that will ensure veterans more timely access to care , while bringing much needed competitive pressure to bear on the VA care system .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If he is truly going to put the care of veterans above the agency he leads , McDonald should make good on his promise and champion patient choice expansion, rather than treat it as a pilot project .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In all honesty, the great risk for McDonald in the new year is that he'll ""go native"" and embrace, defend and shield the dysfunctional culture of the department he promised to change .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's a risk, and a temptation, for anyone who is charged with leading a large bureaucracy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We cannot allow it .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perhaps McDonald's slowness in taking action is part of a strategy of presenting himself as a friend to VA employees in order to earn their trust and confidence .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But it's not bureaucrats who have lost trust in the VA -- it's veterans, taxpayers and Congress .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It remains to be seen whether he'll reveal himself to be a tough-love manager who will stand up to the self-serving bureaucrats who have proven time and again that they ""care"" more about their job security and compensation than the patients they are supposed to serve .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If McDonald, and the entire VA, want to show that they truly ""care"" about veterans in 2015 , they should resolve to take off the cheesy ICARE pins and get real results for veterans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My advice to veterans, their families and advocates is this: Keep up the pressure .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The VA bureaucracy is expecting that with scandals fading from the headlines, attention will move elsewhere .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All they want is to don their pins and go back to the same old way of doing business .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Editor's note: The following column first appeared in the Washington Times .,other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The now-consumed 2014 has been perfectly described by some commentators as the year when facts died .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Politicians, mobs in the streets and their willing accomplices in the media swamped us with lies, obfuscations or riots manifest because , as author Thomas Sowell has noted , ""What matters today is how well you can concoct a story that fits people's preconceptions and arouses their emotions . Politicians like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, professional demagogues like Al Sharpton and innumerable irresponsible people in the media have shown that they have great talent in promoting a lynch mob.""  None of this is unique to 2014, however , nor is the aptitude to stir up a lynch mob the exclusive purview of politicians .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has been both the vocation and avocation of liberal media darlings for a very long time .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2014, with almost perfect timing and illustrating the farce of the left, a liberal favorite -- New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd -- was exposed by the Sony email hack for just how much hypocrisy and contrivance rules her world .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An Internet search of Ms  Dowd brings up a whole host of approving profiles and interviews over the years, with a particular column considered by her sycophants as one of her greatest accomplishments: the ""takedown"" of former New York Times investigative reporter Judith Miller .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ms  Dowd provided what many thought was the coup de grace against Ms  Miller when she wrote that column about her then-colleague at The New York Times , excoriating Ms  Miller for her coverage of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction WMD) leading up to the Iraq war .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ms  Miller , you see , had done the unthinkable .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She reported what her investigation found on the issue , which also happened to be what the Bush administration and scores of other governments had also determined : Saddam was pursuing a WMD program and an untold number of those weapons were developed and undeclared .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As her fellow liberal colleagues piled on Ms  Miller , Ms  Dowd's column, dripping in ridicule and moral authority, condemned the reporter for being a ""stenographer"" for the Bush administration .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ms  Dowd complained Ms  Miller's work ""fit too perfectly"" with what the White House had been asserting about WMD .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In other words ,  Ms  Dowd accused Ms  Miller of being too close to her subject , essentially of colluding with others, of selling out to make someone happy or to further a shared agenda .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was absurd and petty .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But what we didn't know at the time was that it was also a perfect case of projection .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In emails revealed late last year by the Sony Pictures hack, Ms  Dowd, The New York Times' supposed paragon of journalistic ethics, was discovered to have assured a Sony executive that she would be sure to make her ""look great"" in a column, and appeared to promise to show the column to the executive's husband, a former Times reporter, beforehand .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After the column ran , more emails were exchanged, with Ms  Dowd telling the executive , ""I hope you're happy ... let's do another."" After her subject declared the columnist her ""favorite person,"" Ms  Dowd gushed , ""You're mine! You're amazing.""  Ms  Dowd has since denied that she provided the column in advance .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's possible .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So was it a draft that was provided? And by someone other than herself?  For those who might suggest this mistake of Ms Dowd's was a one-off, issues of character inform everything we do .",par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hypocrisy doesn't sneak up on you once .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's part of how you relate to the world .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bill Keller, executive editor of The New York Times from 2003 to 2011, confirmed to the left-wing blog Media Matters in 2011 that the newspaper's treatment of Ms  Miller was due to politics and to assuage the leftist critics .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mr  Keller confessed , ""I let a year go by when a lot of people, particularly people on the left, became disenchanted with the Times because they saw it as having been cheerleaders for the war . I think I could have saved the paper a lot of trouble and some damage by dealing with [Ms  Miller's reporting] much sooner.""  Facts do tend to be pesky things, as Ms  Dowd and the rest of The New York Times crew found in 2014 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After years of morally superior, self-righteous preening, they had a problem : Judith Miller was proven right about WMD in Iraq .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Revealed in a 2010 Wikileaks document dump , The New York Times finally wrote a 10,000 word story on ""abandoned chemical weapons"" in Iraq as it became evident our troops continued to be injured by them and their existence could no longer be denied .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The New York Sun suggested the Times' story be viewed as ""journalism's longest correction,"" and was ""designed to try to extricate the Gray Lady from all these charges about how President George W  Bush and his camarilla lied about the danger of Saddam's chemical arsenal .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It turns out that Iraq was littered with thousands of shells containing poison gas , like Sarin.""  In that 2005 column attacking Ms  Miller , Ms  Dowd dramatically warned her readers if Ms  Miller remained a reporter at The New York Times, the newspaper itself would be at risk .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ten years later, now with the Times on the verge of collapse, forced retirements, layoffs and plunging ad revenue, the facts are teaching a lesson in irony and hypocrisy to Ms  Dowd and everyone else at the Times who jettisoned the truth to soothe jealousies and pander to politics .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last year NFL star Ray Rice committed a single act of unforgettable and inexcusable violence against then fiancee Janay Palmer .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rice was later cut by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended by the NFL .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He won his appeal and is now clear to play , if a team will have him .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The couple's botched press conference in May , where he failed to publicly apologize to Janay , led many to condemn him further .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fox Sports wrote , ""Most of what (Ray Rice) said left the public and media shaking their heads."" I met with Ray the day before that botched press conference while working at the Raven's training camp to help rookies and free agents better handle experiences with high school and college bullying .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I encouraged him , when the time was right , to continue his anti-bullying crusade .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His eyes watered because he deeply wants to be a hero to children again .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why would an anti-bullying advocate want Rice to have a second chance and to stay in the anti-bullying game under the right circumstances? Because Ray's deplorable but isolated act does not come close to the damage caused by bullying , and it doesn't make him a bully .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We need more people like him who , once amends are made , to combat what is now the #1 form of child abuse in America .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rice is even willing to get political to fight bullying .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He supported ""Grace's Law,"" a landmark, anti-cyberbullying law passed in Maryland .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""I truly hope that he continues his anti-bullying work,"" says Christine McComas, mother of the late Grace McComas, 15 , whose suicide is attributed to cyberbullying .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""His help was probably the single biggest factor that led to the new anti-cyberbullying law named after our daughter , which has already saved lives . His empathy and support of our family in our worst hour will never be forgotten . I have four daughters , so I'm sensitive to domestic violence . I have no reason to believe he is a serial abuser , and think he should be given the chance to redeem himself . Maryland owes a lot to that man.""  Also ,  people within the Ravens organization who knew Ray well told me that what happened in that elevator was inexcusable, yet also did not define Ray's real character .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Matt Lauer of the TODAY Show , while interviewing Janay , said he received numerous phone calls from people who know Ray personally .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also said that what happened in that elevator was an aberration from his usually strong character .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rice is guilty of a single act of inexcusable violence ; an act Janay says didn't happen before and hasn't happened since that fateful day .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By contrast, most acts of bullying are premeditated, and don't stem from flashes of anger but rather contempt and disdain toward a target .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bullies, including domestic abusers, wed power to fear as part of a psychological campaign of cruelty in order to dominate, control, intimidate and isolate another .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet Janay says Ray's behavior before or after this one event includes none of this .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In nearly a year since the punch felt around the NFL, not one woman has come forward to accuse Rice of similar abuse .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This supports Janay's statement that what happened was an isolated incident , something Janay said during her TODAY Show interview with Matt Lauer .",no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to Janay, good may come from this single and deplorable act .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She told Lauer that though the claims of serial abuse are false , ""God chose us for a reason."" The couple also says that this incident , which pushed Ray into mandatory and intense counseling , made them better people, including how it compelled them to rededicate themselves to their Christian faith .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If we can't give the Rice family the benefit of the doubt , then let's give them the benefit of time this new year , which will tell us whether he has truly seen the light .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"President Obama's plan, announced Friday , to make community college free for promising students , will be seen by some as a game-changer .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the president noted in his speech , his proposal  -- ""America's College Promise"" -- is based on Gov  Bill Haslam's Tennessee Promise program , which offers free tuition to students attending two years of community or technical college .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While the president's plan will certainly make community college accessible to many more students , it is also far from clear that such students will benefit .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the president's best intentions -- absent serious reform -- pressuring community colleges to improve outcomes , graduation rates have no reason to rise .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And by directing more students to community colleges without demanding higher standards -- students will become eligible for two free years of tuition if they maintain merely a 2.5 GPA, hardly stellar in this age of rampant grade inflation--the president's plan might, perversely, worsen graduation rates .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To that end, the president insists that participating schools will need to ""adopt promising and evidence-based institutional reforms to improve student outcomes."" Indeed ,  the success of his proposal depends on demanding a greater degree of accountability from community colleges , though it's not exactly clear what such reforms might entail .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Regardless of how it all turns outModd-NU , the president's proposal will not solve the larger problems facing American higher education, namely, ever-rising college tuition and student debt .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Further ,  despite his pledge to ""[help] every American afford a higher education,"" large federal subsidies for community colleges might exacerbate such problems .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Flush with new funding , community colleges might, for instance, be tempted to imitate their 4-year peers and increase spending on administrators, frivolous capital projects, and other extravagant amenities .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tuition hikes would, in turn, invariably follow--the brunt of which would be borne by students ineligible for the new federal subsidies .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"At present, nearly 60 percent of community college students do not finish their degrees within 6 years of enrolling .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As such, it's likely that newly subsidized students -- many of whom will not graduate over the course of their two year subsidies -- would inevitably need to worry about tuition increases as well .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As more American families and students question the value of a college degree , it's essential -- as the president rightly does -- to emphasize that college graduates outperform their non-degree holding peers on a wide range of outcomes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Editor's note: The following article originally appeared in The Hill and on TheHill.com website .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dan Pfeiffer's office is next to the Oval Office .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The cheek-by-jowl location reflects the importance of his job as senior adviser guiding President Obama's image and message going into his final two years in the White House .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the moment, the president and Pfeiffer are on a hot streak .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Polls show Obama's approval numbers climbing .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""It's an 18-point gap [better than] Bush and the same as Reagan's,"" Pfeiffer said , comparing Obama's current approval rating to that of President George W  Bush and President Reagan at the equivalent point in their second terms .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Strong public support is central to the president's strategy of keeping the loyalty of Senate Democrats .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If large numbers of Democrats in Congress run away from a president with bad poll numbers , Republicans can put the president on the defensive for the remainder of his time in office .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Major defections by Senate Democrats will also allow the Republican majority in the Senate to stop filibusters and potentially override Obama's vetoes .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The issues at stake range from construction of the Keystone XL pipeline to efforts to change and repeal Obamacare, as well as undo immigration reform, financial regulation, the opening of new relations with Cuba and new limits on greenhouse gases .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pfeiffer does not see any issue where Republicans can expect to undo a presidential veto: ""Not one,"" he emphasized .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Keystone XL pipeline is the one instance in which Pfeiffer acknowledges that veto may have to be used in the first place .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But he does not expect such a move to hurt the president's revival in the polls .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is an issue , Pfeiffer argued, often cited by Republicans who don't like the president anyway .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But most ""people don't have super-strong feelings about it,"" he said .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""They are not energized about it, especially at a time of low gas prices . [Polls show] people generally prefer it but this is not a huge issue in their lives.""  Pfeiffer also expects constant fights with Republicans on Capitol Hill over the Environmental Protection Agency's use of the Clean Air Act to better regulate greenhouse gas emissions .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The Republican policy is wrong,"" he said . ""I feel good about our chances [because] people feel strongly about clean air and clean water.""  With his current good poll numbers, the president is able to go on a political offensive despite taking a beating in last fall's midterms and ceding control of the Senate, as well as the House, to Republicans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pfeiffer ties the president's rising popularity to the success of his economic policies but also to the Republican Party's difficulties with any voter not in the Koch brothers' tax bracket .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The GOP has huge trouble on cultural affinity,"" said Pfeiffer .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Republican tax policies, opposition to regulating pollution , their effort to repeal Dodd - Frank - it all favors the rich ... We need to engage them on all that.""  ""Engage them"" is the idea at the heart of the president's plan for his last two years .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The GOP is on defense as it responds to proposals increasing access to community college as well as increased tax breaks for families in need of childcare and with two working spouses .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pfeiffer starts looking around his office for a card recently given to senior staff that reminds them they are in ""the Fourth Quarter.""  The quote comes from Obama .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pfeiffer tells the story of the president looking at Green Bay Packers' player Randall Cobb during a rally in Wisconsin and making the case that fourth quarter football is ""when big things happen.""  In a moment of off-script pique during last week's State of the Union address, the president reminded Republicans he cannot run for election again because he already beat them in two presidential elections .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That confidence leads him to conclude that losing control of the Senate in the midterms is only a momentary set back in the big picture -- the total game and the legacy of the Obama presidency .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Pfeiffer told the New York Times in advance of the State of the Union speech , the nation's economic resurgence under President Obama creates ""a Chicken Little problem [for Republicans] -- all the doom and gloom they predicted did not come to pass.""  The president crowed about ""good news, people"" in the State of the Union speech : He listed 11 million jobs created by American business in the last five years; more people with health insurance; cuts in the deficit; record stock prices; higher high school graduation rates and lower gas prices, as evidence of his success .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious ; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,"" the president said .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" . ... So the verdict is clear . Middle class economics works ... and these polices will continue to work as long as politics don't get in the way.""  Pfeiffer and other top administration officials think they can further improve their poll numbers by getting Republicans to debate the president's new proposals for increasing wages for working Americans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good news in foreign policy is also possible but , unlike most second-term presidents, Obama is not abandoning the domestic agenda .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Obama's poll numbers will not decide the 2016 race for the White House , Pfeiffer said , because the ""biggest factor is the popularity of the nominee."" But good polls will prevent Democrats from ""distancing"" themselves from Hillary Clinton, Sen  Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass .) or another other nominee, and lead to better turnout .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is also part of the Obama team's fourth quarter plan to end the game as winners .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is also part of the Obama team's fourth quarter plan to end the game as winners .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report the economy added about 230,000 jobs in November , and the White House will tout the economic recovery has created jobs for a record 57 months in a row .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Voters rejected that message by ousting Democrats in the mid-term elections , quite simply because the President's recovery has simply not delivered enough good paying , full time jobs .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the wake of the financial crisis, unemployment peaked at 10 percent , but the five year recovery has scored only 2.3 percent annual growth and added only about 10 million jobs--a mere 7 percent increase from the recession low of 129 million .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Reagan also inherited a mess--high oil prices, double digit interest rates and unemployment peaking at 10.8 percent .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His recovery, over the period comparable to the Obama expansion, registered 4.8 percent annual GDP growth and created 14.3 million jobs--a 16 percent increase from a recession low of 89 million .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The difference was governing philosophy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Obama put billions into cumbersome, economically questionable government programs like solar energy, expanded federal entitlements, imposed higher taxes on small entrepreneurs, and burdened businesses and banks with costly and ineffective regulations .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Manufacturing and construction--hamstrung by onerous new restrictions on factories and bank lending--have not adequately recovered .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today, both industries employ about 1.6 million fewer workers than before the recession .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lost are many jobs paying more than $25 per hour that once helped undergird the middle class .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Democrats, such as Senator Charles Schumer blame new technologies and advocate yet more big government , but innovation that raises labor productivity has been a dominant force since the first axle and wheel , and Obama's failures indicate paucity of Schumer's prescription .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More striking has been the failure of U.S  manufacturers to apply home-grown technologies to more effectively boost domestic manufacturing, increase exports and compete with imports .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During the 2008 campaign, Obama promised to improve U.S  competitive performance by addressing China's undervalued currency , which artificially disadvantages U.S.-based factories, but hasn't .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the Obama recovery began , the trade deficit with China has increased $190 billion , destroying 1.6 million American jobs .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to the Keystone pipeline, the Administration continues to block petroleum development off the Atlantic, Pacific and Eastern Gulf Coasts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The United States needlessly imports about 5.5 million barrels of petroleum each day at an annual cost of $120 billion a year .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That kills another 1 million jobs a year in construction, petroleum refining, manufacturing, and professional services .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Health benefits costs are about 50 percent higher for U.S  manufacturers than for competitors in Japan and Germany .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Obama promised to do something about that too , but the Affordable Care Act mostly subsidizes health coverage for previously uninsured and lower income Americans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Premiums paid by businesses keep rising faster than inflation, further burdening U.S  competitiveness in international markets .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"High health care costs, coupled with slack in the jobs market, encourage employers to split full time positions into part-time jobs to avoid paying for health insurance and other benefits .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Seven million Americans , who want full time employment , are consigned to part- time work--often in retailing and other lower paying service activities , where jobs are more easily divided among several workers .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Workers in finance, technology and other high skilled professions are getting good raises , while wages for lower-skilled workers--especially those stuck in part-time positions--lag inflation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Combined with the shortage of mid-skilled jobs in construction and manufacturing, those forces have driven down median family income to $52,120 from about $56,436 prior to the recession .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Families near the top have registered significant gains , while the majority of families have permanently lost much more buying power than those averages indicate .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Getting America working and incomes rising again requires better managing globalization, freeing up U.S  energy production and smarter, lower-cost business regulations .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Without pro-growth policies, the monthly jobs report will continue to bring depressing news to America's working families and lots of deceptive media hype from White House .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's a prediction: expect a narrative to emerge in certain media outlets in the coming days that Tuesday night's State of the Union speech was a grand return to form for President Obama .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The elite, east-coast intelligencia line will be that the beleaguered lame duck president--facing a hostile, conservative Congress--regained his momentum with renewed energy and purpose .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How Obama Got His Groove Back , Washington- style .",no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Groove aside , the fact remains that Obama's next-to-last State of the Union address did not substantially address two of the most pressing issues currently facing our nation and that matter most to its military veterans: the lack of a clear United States national security strategy -- to include the crisis facing our military -- and the inability of the VA bureaucracy care to deliver timely health care to millions of our veterans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But you wouldn't know it by listening to Tuesday night's State of the Union address .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
President Obama is living in a fantasy world .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The president says that we're ""stopping ISIL's advance."" But in reality ,  his campaign of airstrikes have not been successful , and ISIS controls more territory in Iraq and Syria today than ever before .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He also boldly claimed that ""we're slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need,"" but this statement too just doesn't match up with reality .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today, nearly 250,000 veterans are still stuck in the VA claims backlog and another 290,000 languish in the appeals process .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Is that still ""too many,"" Mr  President?  Unfortunate events will likely force the president's attention to these issues in 2015 -- just like ISIS did in Iraq and Phoenix did for the VA in 2014 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  President Obama could be proactive and get ahead of these issues by pursuing the following four agenda items :.  1 \. Articulate a real national security strategy .",par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The president's plan for ""leading from behind"" -- and that national security and foreign policy boils down to ""don't do stupid stuff"" -- is no substitute for a real strategy , as deteriorating situations in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Ukraine and elsewhere prove .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Likewise ,  denying the nature of the enemy we face (""ISIS is not Islamic"") only muddies the water further , emboldening our enemies and confusing our allies .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Obama also touted ending the 14 year-long war in Afghanistan , but ""ending"" is different than ""winning."" His telegraphed withdrawals have pulled us out of conflicts before they're resolved , creating power vacuums in Iraq - and soon in Afghanistan - that leave America more vulnerable .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And incredibly, for the first time since 9/11, the president failed to even mention the Taliban or Al Qaeda  - both of which are far from ""on the run"" as he proclaimed in 2012 and are advancing and actively challenging the West .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 \. Get serious about fixing defense spending .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead of cutting fat , the president's ill-conceived defense budget sequester has slashed into the muscle of our military force .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The administration should strive to replace defense sequestration, by implementing serious and commensurate acquisitions and compensation reforms .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Reforming these areas will reduce Pentagon budgetary pressures caused by massive weapons system cost-overruns and exploding personnel costs, allowing for a more strategic allocation of war-fighting resources .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to live within a fiscally responsible reality, and most importantly maintain the world's most capable military , the administration and Congress must get serious about real DoD spending reform .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His address last night didn't even mention sequestration .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 \. Develop and implement a plan to tackle the national debt .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Respected military leaders like Marine General James Mattis, Admiral Mike Mullen, and many others recognize that the biggest long-term threat to our national security is our massive national debt .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At more than $18 trillion and growing, the debt is on track to double under President Obama .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is absolutely vital to the fiscal, economic, and military strength of our country that we have a serious plan to get our debt under control through reductions in spending and significant reforms across the government .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 \. Implement more accountability and choice at the VA .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The VA reforms passed by Congress last year were a good first step, but will not address the deeper, systemic culture problems at VA .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the next Congress, the president should champion even deeper reforms at VA to bring accountability for poor performing employees throughout the department and to expand health care options for veterans outside the VA system .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These basic principles would not only address a campaign promise the president has failed to deliver on (""fixing the VA"") but would show that he is finally serious about improving veterans' access to the quality health care they earned .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What the president misses, and even defies , in his latest list of proposals is that Americans don't think government isn't doing enough .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They think government does too much , that most of what it does , it does poorly , and that it doesn't attend to the issues that matter to them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Focusing on the four agenda items above would send a message that the president is finally serious about governing in his last two years in office .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's probably too much to ask for Obama to change his approach at this stage in his presidency -- but it's essential if he wants to avoid a legacy of division, defiance and neglect .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And if the president continues on his current course? Well, the items listed above will become part of a compelling agenda for his potential successors as they take to the campaign trail for 2016 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And if the president continues on his current course? Well, the items listed above will become part of a compelling agenda for his potential successors as they take to the campaign trail for 2016 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Is President Obama trying to sabotage Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential run? That's one take-away from his feisty State of the Union address , in which Mr  Obama did three things : first ,  he moved the Democratic agenda far to the left , where Hillary is not entirely comfortable ; second ,  he rebuffed the clear preference of voters that he work with Congress, by making the cornerstone of his address proposals unacceptable to the GOP and third , he assured the country that our foreign policy (Hillary's foreign policy) is working .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Americans are not at all convinced , 13 days after the vicious attacks on Charlie Hedbo in Paris , that Obama's ""broader strategy"" is leading to ""a safer, more prosperous world."" Obama says he believes in a ""smarter kind of American leadership"" ; for many in the country, the assertion borders on arrogance .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
None of these messages works for Hillary .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr  Obama's focus on the middle class is unsurprising .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lagging income growth for the average American has emerged as the likely debate in 2016, for good reason .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The numbers show that during the Obama recovery, the middle class has , as Joe Biden put it , been ""left behind.""  The issue is valid ; Mr  Obama's progressive approach to helping average Americans - relying on more taxation and more government programs -- is not .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite Americans listing job creation as their number one concern for the past six years , putting people to work has never been President Obama's priority .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He has not encouraged businesses to hire , either through reducing tax rates on employers or by expanding business opportunities - through trade, or reduced regulations, for instance .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the contrary ,  his economic prescriptions have raised costs for employers through the onerous provisions of Obamacare and his efforts to raise the minimum wage .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As of this SOTU address, he has doubled down , since many of the suggested tax hikes will land on small companies that pay taxes as individuals , and as his proposed sick pay and maternity leave will raise the costs of hiring .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Such policies have led to labor participation rates that are still bumping along historical lows , a crisis in our disability program, and stagnant wages .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A short course in economics might help the White House : a tighter jobs market will raise wages .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The government raising wages will put people out of work .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's that simple .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Obama revisited his familiar theme of making sure all Americans have a ""fair shot"" ; he wants to raise taxes to make sure the rich do ""their fair share."" He has never laid out what that share should be , but he has tried hard to convince Americans that the wealthy don't play ""by the same set of rules.""  It's a tired song , and Americans have never bought the program .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A recent Rasmussen poll showed that 60% of Americans think the country is ""fair"" and ""decent."" They don't believe that income distribution is the answer .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They believe in growth, in optimism, in everyone getting ahead .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The tax proposals outlined by President Obama are old school, and dead on arrival in the Republican Congress , as he well knows .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Congress has indicated an eagerness to work with the president on tax reform , but has prioritized changing the dysfunctional corporate tax code .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The president understands that by placing individual tax hikes first in the queue , he has just undermined any chance for bipartisan agreement .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And ,  by adopting the priorities of the left , which emphasize wealth redistribution and also embrace further exploiting the financial sector , he is drafting behind liberal icon Senator Elizabeth Warren .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a slap at Hillary, for two reasons .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  Hillary is unquestionably uncomfortable putting on a progressive cloak .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the fall campaigns she awkwardly mimicked Liz Warren's rhetoric , embarrassing herself with the head-scratcher ""Don't let anyone tell you that it's businesses and corporations that create jobs.""  Hillary is a successful, wealthy woman who pretends otherwise and stubs her toe on money issues, such as when she described herself and her husband as ""dead broke"" upon leaving the White House .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Also ,  Hillary has difficulty distancing herself from Wall Street ; the Wall Street Journal has reported that she and her husband have raised nearly $5 million from Goldman Sachs alone .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's also awkward for Mrs  Clinton that the president has burned relations with Republicans ... again .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In his speech , while talking about ""A better politics"" in which ""we debate without demonizing each other,"" the president also threatened to veto a number of GOP initiatives .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Voters have shown they want the government to function  - to repair our infrastructure, reform our dreadful tax code , to compete more effectively with our trading rivals , to streamline our outdated government agencies .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For six years Mr  Obama has blamed the GOP for standing in the way of his programs ; now he will be the obstructer-in-chief .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From his State of the Union address, it is clear that he is not interested in partnering with Republicans .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His aggressive executive actions over the past several weeks on preventing deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants and unilaterally overhauling our Cuba policy were the tip of the iceberg .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mr  Obama is not into compromise .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Voters do not like the president's ""go it alone"" program ; they understand why the nation's founders included those pesky checks and balances .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Obama will make it more difficult for any Democrat trying to succeed him to convince voters that he or she will ""work across the aisle"" - a claim that Hillary might actually credibly make .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally ,  Obama's insufficient resolve against the threat of Islamic terrorism, and conviction that his efforts overseas are bearing fruit , are alarming .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like Muggles fearful of naming the fearsome Voldemort , Obama seems to think if he just doesn't say ""Islamic terrorism"" out loud , the menace will pass him by .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His embarrassing absence in Paris, his waffle on Syria, his underestimation of ISIS - it all speaks to his pretense that we have won the War on Terror .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That our president can be so misled and so misleading on a matter of such grave importance is horrifying .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That Hillary Clinton was the enabler of his clueless foreign policy is a serious problem for the former first lady .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And ,  for the country, should she be elected .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And ,  for the country, should she be elected .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last week, France faced the threat that is arguably the toughest to defeat -- a threat from within, from its own terrorists .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By now, the stories are familiar .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
France has a problem with homegrown radicals .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At least 900 French citizens are among the 2,000 to 3,000 westerners who've left home for jihadist training or to fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In many ways, the western jihadist represents the worst threat .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Able to speak the language fluently, completely familiar with their home countries, and possessing a key weapon -- an American, British, French, or German passport -- they can easily cross international boundaries .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The training makes them deadly -- the Paris attacks were notable for their deadly precision and meticulous planning .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their citizenship makes them mobile .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's why any American strategy to defeat jihad has to include measures to not just deny passports to American terrorists, but also strip them of citizenship .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is basic common sense .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most Americans would be surprised to know that joining Al Qaeda or ISIS - the Islamic State - isn't grounds for losing citizenship .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The law currently provides that Americans can lose citizenship when they enter or serve in the armed forces of an enemy foreign state .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But ISIS and Al Qaeda are not ""foreign states,"" so the law doesn't apply .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's time to close this loophole .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Congress, legislation was introduced last session to address those concerns .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was not approved .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now ,  in the new Congress - with Republicans in control of both the House and Senate - there's a renewed push to safeguard the homeland .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last week, Representative Ted Poe introduced a measure that revokes passports from Americans who join terrorist organizations .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And ,  in the days ahead, Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Steve King are expected to introduce legislation that would strip citizenship from terrorist traitors .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not an imaginary threat .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not only have Americans joined ISIS , some have even lost their lives fighting for jihadists .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  as many as 40 men from Minneapolis alone have joined Islamic groups abroad .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And just last week in Chicago, A U.S  citizen was indicted by a federal grand jury - charged with attempting to travel overseas to fight alongside the ISIS operating in Iraq and Syria .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These men aren't just threats to the United States ; they're also threats to our closest allies .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For our allies, the American passport is a ticket of entry, no visa required .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And ,  similarly, for British, French, and other allies, their passport is a ticket of entry into the United States .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The door is wide open for terrorists to take advantage of centuries of friendship and trust .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is time we slam that door shut .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course stripping citizenship and revoking passports represent just two small steps - but critical ones - towards a sane national security strategy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  it's difficult to take even these small steps with the Obama administration steadfastly refuses to name our enemies (Mr  President, our enemies are Islamic radicals , not generic ""extremists"") , accurately describe their ideology (no, they are not ""nihilists"") , or even to acknowledge their obvious, widespread appeal in the Muslim world .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was sad and embarrassing for Americans to watch as even the leader of the Palestinian Authority marched in Paris against Islamic extremism , yet our president or vice president were nowhere to be found .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even liberal journalists called this absence ""pathetic.""  Marches don't defeat terrorists , but when dozens of world leaders stand together , it makes a statement of determination that is critical for our citizens to see .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When our President makes a stand , it signals our nation's resolve , and his absence signaled our government's weakness .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the days and weeks ahead, Congress can send a very different message by passing much needed legislation, putting it on the President's desk, and daring him to veto legislation that would prevent exactly the kind of attack France faced last week .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After almost six full years in office, we fully understand the President's approach to combatting terrorism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A recipe that mixes drone strikes with appeasement -- that pulls troops from combat and sends captive terrorists back to the Middle -- is now a proven failure .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In my bestselling book, ""Rise of ISIS: A Threat We Can't Ignore,"" I demonstrated the consequences of that failure .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jihad rages across the Middle East, Boko Harem rampages through Nigeria , and Afghanistan teeters on the brink of disaster .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the west, recent terror attacks in Canada, Australia, and Paris show jihadists ability to inspire even western Muslims with a message of pure hate and evil .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will the Obama administration change course? Will it finally acknowledge the true dimensions of the threat? It can start with a dose of common sense .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It can start by protecting America from terrorist traitors .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several news outlets are reporting that the attackers identified themselves as being from Al Qaeda in Yemen .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But whatever branch of Islamic terrorism is responsible for this heinous crime , the targeting of the French paper is no accident .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On its cover today is a caricature of a controversial novelist, Michel Houellebecq , whose book ""Submission"" forecasts a France run by Muslims and where polygamy is practiced .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the last tweet posted by the magazine was a mocking spoof of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlie Hebdo has been a target before .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Its offices were firebombed in 2011 after the paper ran a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad vowing ""100 lashes if you don't die laughing!""  The vicious attack would be shocking news even if the target was an insurance company office .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But by singling out a media enterprise -- especially one that has dared to poke fun at Islam -- the terrorists are sending an even louder message , one designed to frighten and intimidate .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We saw the same evil calculation in the decision by ISIS to kill journalists James Foley and Steve Sotloff and to circulate video of their beheadings .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was a way to amplify the propaganda value of such executions and generate even more coverage by journalists who felt an instinctive kinship with their fallen brethren .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That ploy worked , as ISIS sparked weeks of anguished coverage around the globe , and the images of the soon-to-be-murdered journalists, published far too often in my view, became the face of Islamic terror .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After that , even as the U.S  and its allies struck back at ISIS in Iraq and Syria , the coverage greatly receded .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Terrorists understand the media's need to personalize a tragic story .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wednesday's attack was also a far bloodier version of the Sony Pictures hacking , which was aimed at paralyzing and humiliating a media company over its ill-advised film that depicted North Korean strongman Kim Jong-un's head being blown up .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That act of cyberterrorism also served as a warning to other media outfits that might take on North Korea .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlie Hebdo specialized in skewering sacred cows .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The danger now is that journalists around the world will engage in self- censorship , that they will pull back on aggressive reporting and analysis of Islamic terrorism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For every potentially provocative article, headline or cartoon, some will ask themselves , is this worth the risk? Wouldn't it be easier, safer , to let this one go?

"Commentators from both sides of the political aisle have discussed the ""optics"" of President Obama's absence from the massive, anti-terrorism march in Paris on January 11 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sadly, they've all missed the point .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It would have represented a glaring hypocrisy for Mr  Obama, or any highly- ranked official from his administration , to attend the rally .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A sad fact about our pundit class, conservative or progressive, is that they too often miss the obvious .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That condition infects both critics and supporters of the Obama administration .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They simply cannot connect the dots with this leader .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After all ,  he is an unusual president .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So let me draw a line between the unconnected dots .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just two years ago, the administration blamed the killing of the American ambassador to Libya, and three security personnel, on a video that negatively depicted the prophet Muhammad .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Remember that?  You see , it was an unknown, bigoted Christian man from California who single- handedly caused the death of our ambassador .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to the administration , the film by Nakoula Basseley Nakoulahad sparked spontaneous riots to defend Muhammad's honor , and our ambassador got caught up in the mayhem .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mr  Obama called the filmmaker a ""shadowy character,"" and in front of the United Nations and the world, blamed the attack on the ""disgusting"" movie .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At that podium, he declared that ""the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.""  Congressional hearings later proved that the violence in Benghazi was due to a coordinated terrorist attack , and had nothing to do with a protest over the movie .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But administration officials stuck to the lie .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just a few weeks after the attack, the filmmaker was arrested on parole charges by federal authorities , probably taking orders from Attorney General Holder .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now fast-forward to the rally in Paris -- the one that Holder would not deem worthy to attend , even though he was in Paris at the time .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The one that President Obama, nor Vice President Biden, nor Secretary of State Kerry would attend either , even though other major world leaders rushed to Paris to demonstrate their solidarity .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let me draw the line between the dots a little darker :.  Q : Who did the terrorists attack in Paris on January 7?  A: A satirist magazine that had mocked Christians for years .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q: Why did the terrorists kill those specific journalists and cartoonists?  A : For a mocking portrayal of Muhammad .,par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Q : Isn't that the same issue that had enraged the White House after the Benghazi attack?  A : You betcha .,par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ""bad optics"" that so many pundits are complaining about actually fit perfectly into the philosophical mindset of this White House .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They do not want us to insult their Islamist friends .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the eyes of the Obama administration, the jihadists in Libya and France committed the same savagery for the same reason .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Give the administration credit for consistency .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're not about to appear sympathetic to a French cartoonist when they had condemned the filmmaker from California .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Having persecuted the latter , they weren't about to march to defend the former .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What represents bad optics to most civilized people's worldview represents good optics to the Obama administration's worldview .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I get that, too .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I must admit, though , that I get irritated sometimes when a group of people bring a lawsuit to get rid of the town creche or when someone wishes me ""Happy Holidays."" It bothers me when universities remove Christmas trees or Christmas concerts are canceled because it offends those who aren't religious or Christian .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What's this mystery activity that more and more people are participating in?  Pilgrimage .,no-unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The U.N  puts the total number of people going on a pilgrimage each year at 330 million .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A bombshell Vatican report released Monday that gives a green light to the social activism of left-wing U.S  nuns is the latest example of how the more liberal papacy of Pope Francis could affect the outcome of the 2016 US elections .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The report forms the conclusion of an investigation, known as an ""Apostolic Visitation,"" into the practices and beliefs of sisters across the U.S that was launched in 2008 under the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI amid long-standing concerns that many orders had lost their way .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although there are a significant number of vibrant orthodox orders, such as the pro-life Sisters of Life, the Dominican Sisters of St  Cecilia and the Little Sisters of the Poor (who are currently fighting the ObamaCare contraception mandate) , a much larger number of orders have rejected Catholic doctrines on the divinity of Christ, on sacramental theology and on moral issues such as abortion, contraception and gay marriage .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead they substituted in alternative, non-Christian forms of spirituality that rejected fundamental Catholic truths, accompanied by a turn toward aggressively partisan left-wing social activism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What was being investigated was on show in 2012, with a group of left-wing nuns forming a slick national campaign called the ""Nuns on the Bus,"" campaigning against the proposed Ryan budget plan .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last year their tour topic was another Democrat favorite -- amnesty for illegal immigrants .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Heading up the travelling sisters is Sr . Simone Campbell -- a lawyer and lobbyist who also led the nuns who defied the US bishops' condemnation of ObamaCare, signed a letter supporting the law and attended the signing ceremony at which she received a hug from President Obama .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At that time, the power of the ""Nuns on the Bus"" was limited by their designation as rebels .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With a Vatican investigation under way, it made it difficult for the nuns to claim to be the authentic moral voice of Catholicism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  since then, Pope Francis has taken over and brought with him a certain interpretation of Catholic social teaching which adheres a lot closer to the tenets of the Democratic Party than more universally acknowledged truths pushed by Popes Benedict XVI and John Paul II .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The results of the probe will no doubt invite speculation that Pope Francis has had heavy influence over the findings of the report , which can comfortably be described as a whitewash .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The report mentions nothing of the ""secularist mentality"" and radical feminism that had been given as the reason for the launch of the investigation , and is mostly a document of praise which offers little-to-no criticism, no disciplinary action and says the nuns' work resonates with Pope Francis' emphasis on social justice .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The report even manages to take a swipe at the U.S  economy , praising the nuns for working in an economy that too often ""creates inequity and exclusion."" It is better than anything the liberal nuns could have hoped for .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The liberal orders aren't out of the woods yet .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A separate investigation by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith into the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR) -- a coalition of predominantly left-wing orders -- is not complete , and the doctrinal watchdog is likely to find something in a group that prides itself in rebelling against Church teaching .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  Monday's report gives left-wing nuns, and the Democratic Party a big boost for 2016 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Catholic vote has been decisive in modern U.S  politics , and Catholic Democrats have often hyped their faith around election time .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Joe Biden in particular has stood up as the advocate for liberal nuns , recently attending a ""Nuns on the Bus"" rally and in the past reportedly telling Pope Benedict XVI that he was being too hard on them and that he should ""lighten up.""  With a recent Vatican synod appearing to undermine Church teaching on controversial issues , the new report is another blow to more traditional Catholics who , when the radical nuns are talking , have always been able to point out their status as rebels and dissenters ignoring Church teaching .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unless the CDF does a dramatic about-face with its report , the Democrats' favorite nuns will now claim to have Vatican approval .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With a green light from Rome, expect left-wing nuns and the Democrat Party to be emboldened in their push to present the nuns -- and the Democrats -- as the authentic voice of Catholicism , putting the Democrats in a better position to retain and expand upon the often-decisive Catholic vote in 2016 .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""Hope"" is always in the minds of Americans along with good will for any new president .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Much of that good will and almost all of the ""hope,"" that this president could or would be different , is gone .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His expected veto decision on the Keystone pipeline is to appease the environmentalists .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His executive orders allowing millions of illegals to stay in the country rather than be deported is also viewed as a pandering to the fastest growing voting group .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His alteration by executive order creating changes in his health care law have enraged members of Congress that have the real power to change laws .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His attempt to close Guantanamo prison over the objections of Congress is another critical debate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the biggest and most long lasting mistake maybe his withdrawal of ground troops from both Iraq and Afghanistan .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And one he has not yet made may be more severe and dangerous to world peace -- his headlong rush toward an attempt to get a nuclear deal with Iran .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A deal that, in spite of all the reassurances from Secretary of State John Kerry, will enable Iran to make nuclear weapons .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The mainstream media is feeding into this legacy debate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One of the latest examples, The New York magazine cover story of January 11, called the ""Obama History Project.""  The magazine asked 53 historians to weigh in on Barack Obama's legacy and how they think he will be measured 20 years from now .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Historians play a vital role in measuring presidents .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Usually their histories are written decades after the fact when they can go back and review documents and gather facts and see the results of presidential actions from afar and in a cold dissected view .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Historians have certainly altered the view of many former presidents and have actually restored the reputations of a few .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am going to be dead and gone and they will distort it anyways . What I care about is those great young people we saw out there today and making sure they have the same opportunities we all had.""  He turned to his closest friend , also sitting there, Senator Paul Laxalt (R.-Nev .). He said Paul's father was a Basque immigrant sheepherder and his mother a hotel cook .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The last thing a beleaguered Vladimir Putin will want to hear is that Russia has now reached the stage where it desperately needs an IMF-supported economic adjustment program .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Without such a program, it is difficult to see how Russia can regain domestic and international confidence in the management of its economy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Absent the IMF , it is also difficult to see how Russia will be able to avoid the imposition of damaging capital controls on its economy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There can be no denying that Russian policymakers were totally blindsided by the collapse in international oil prices from around $110 a barrel in midsummer to $50 a barrel at present .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All too likely this will prove to have been a very costly lapse in economic policy judgment, particularly considering that energy accounts for around two-thirds of Russian exports and around half of its tax revenues .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A dramatic drop in international oil prices would have been difficult for Russia in normal times , but these are hardly normal times for Russia , since effective financial sanctions are being imposed on it in the context of the ongoing Ukrainian crisis .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Those sanctions have precipitated more than $100 billion in capital flight from Russia since the start of this year .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are also seriously restricting the ability of Russian corporations to refinance their large U.S  dollar debts coming due .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In responding to a burgeoning balance of payments crisis , Russian policymakers appear to have made every mistake in the book .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The central bank was painfully slow to use its large international reserves or interest rate policy to calm market fears about the currency's stability .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Compounding matters , the central bank has managed to convey the impression that the Russian government stands fully behind the Russian corporate sector's more than $600 billion in foreign currency debt .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Worse yet, the central bank's actions have not been backed up by any serious adjustment to the government's spending plans, despite the fact that the oil price now is around 50 percent below the level assumed in the government's budget .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similarly ,  there have been no proposals to reform the insidious interconnection between the government and the corporate sectors , which has seriously undermined confidence in the management of the economy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the government seemingly at sea, the Russian ruble , has lost almost half of its value since the start of the year .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is something that Russia can ill-afford , considering that inflation is already over 9 percent and that the Russian people are all too familiar with the pain associated with very high inflation rates .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The public is already starting to hoard groceries before they get more expensive , and people are rushing to their ATMs while the going is still good .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It would seem to be only a matter of time before they start running on their banks .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Experience amply suggests that it is very hard to regain economic confidence once it has been lost .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The countries in Russia's dire economic circumstances that have succeeded have done so in the context of a carefully coordinated economic adjustment program that had the imprimatur of an outside independent agency like the IMF .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Vladimir Putin to successfully approach the IMF , he would have to back down on his Ukrainian adventure to win Western support .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Considering that to be highly unlikely , Russians should brace themselves for a rough economic ride next year .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For not only is it all too likely that Russia will experience a deep economic recession and double-digit inflation .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It will also be subjected to capital controls that will further distort Russia's already highly distorted economy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"After Russia's GDP plunged by almost 8 percent during the 2008-9 world financial crisis , there was a virtual consensus among Russian economists that Putin's economic model , which depended on the redistribution of revenues from ever-increasing oil prices, along with growing state control over the economy and rampant corruption , was nearly exhausted .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We all know what Putin did .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Upon his presidential reelection in 2012, he issued a slew of laws constraining already limited freedoms of public protest and speech .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The anti-corruption, pro-European revolution in Ukraine was presented as an American plot against Russia .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Following the annexation of Crimea in March 2014, those who opposed the regime were labelled the ""fifth column"" and ""national traitors.""  Then came war in Ukraine -- aggression by proxy or, last fall, by uniformed Russian troops .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Western democracies are portrayed as Russia's mortal enemies , who seek to undermine Moscow's sovereignty and enslave its people .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This Stalinist-style propaganda is designed to justify the Kremlin's aggression against Ukraine, excuse increasing domestic repression, explain away mounting economic hardships and -- most troubling -- perhaps prepare the country for possible aggression against other neighbors .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Both in his end-of-year press-conference and in his New Year's message to the nation, Putin fixed the propaganda pitch to the highest point :.  ""We are defending our independence, our sovereignty and our right to exist,"" he declared .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""We need to accomplish , to realize all that we planned - for ourselves, for the sake of our children, and for the sake of Russia.""  After this, can anyone expect the Russian commander-in-chief to go wobbly on foreign enemies or to abandon ethnic ""brethren"" fighting against an allegedly genocidal ""Nazi junta""-- known to the rest of the world as the elected government in Kiev?  U.S  and European diplomats keep talking about providing Russia with an ""off ramp."" Judging by Putin's rhetoric , there is no ramp high enough for the task .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So long as Putin sticks with the anti-reform choice , escalation appears to be his only tactic for staying in and consolidating power .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In 1992, the House and Senate joined together to pass a resolution designating January 16th as Religious Freedom Day .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This day is based on the anniversary of the 1786 passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, originally authored by Thomas Jefferson .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Congress formally recognized that the ""Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom inspired and shaped the guarantees of religious freedom in the First Amendment.""  President George H  W  Bush issued the first proclamation in 1992 , noting that ""American law and institutions have been shaped by a view of man that recognizes the inherent rights and dignity of individuals.""  For the last 24 years, each president has made an annual declaration and encouraged Americans to ""observe this day through appropriate events and activities in homes, schools, and places of worship.""  To better understand the Founder's intent for this precious right , we must return to the actual text of the 1786 statute .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most notably, it reads : "" ... no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship , place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced ...in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief ; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain , their opinion in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.""  The Founders understood that there is a direct connection between the prosperity and health of a nation and its respect for human rights and religious freedom .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Individual faith grows when people live free of government coercion and control .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In America, any person can live their faith or choose to have no faith; in many parts of the world that simple truth is revolutionary .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This fundamental right at the core of our nation allows the United States to champion religious freedom around the world .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our own State Department's Office of International Religious Freedom appropriately reinforces this value by saying, ""Given the U.S  commitment to religious freedom, and to the international covenants that guarantee it as the inalienable right of every human being , the United States seeks to: Promote freedom of religion and conscience throughout the world as a fundamental human right and as a source of stability for all countries.""  Over the last few years, there have been many heated conversations in our own country about the role of religious freedom in our society, like pubic prayer, abortion, college campus organization, religious symbols, and many others .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last summer's Supreme Court decision affirming the right to live and work in accordance with one's convictions was contentious , but the High Court reinforced the right of Americans to not just have a faith, but to actually enter the marketplace and practice that faith as well .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Religion that is contained only within a church building is a weekend hobby, not a personal faith .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our nation's Founders fled from a regime of religious persecution , sacrificing their lives to birth a new place of liberty .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They not only believed that religious freedom was fundamental to shape this new nation , but that religious freedom was a fundamental human right for all .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As we celebrate and recognize religious freedom today , let us reflect and remember that it has served as an important pillar of this nation from the start .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"On September 21, I, along with 13 other American civilians, experienced a brief glimpse into the life of a U.S  Navy submariner .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the guests of Captain Gene Doyle, the commander of Submarine Squadron 11, we were invited to embark on board the USS HAMPTON (SSN 767), a Los Angeles Class fast attack submarine in the waters near San Diego, California .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The captain of USS Hampton, a no-nonsense, highly respected commander named Lincoln Reifsteck, along with his executive officer, David Fassel and chief of the boat, Richard Moses, welcomed us on board and introduced us to a world few civilians will ever have the honor and opportunity to experience .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We soon learned that Reifsteck's most difficult task wasn't submerging the ship 700 feet below the ocean's surface (the more difficult part is actually the resurfacing process in the crowded waters off San Diego) or even preparing to shoot a tomahawk missile .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead ,  Reifsteck's greatest challenge is keeping his sailors motivated, ready, and vigilant 24 hours a day, 7 days a week over a period of several months (please note, the average age of a submariner is only 22) .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In our short time on board USS HAMPTON, we witnessed Reifsteck's uncanny ability to both motivate and prepare his sailors for any obstacle before them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During 2013, the Hampton was at sea for 298 out of 365 days .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's 82 percent of the year away from family and friends with no access to a telephone, the Internet, or the daily comforts that we as Americans have grown so accustomed to .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a very good reason why submariners earn on average 30 percent more than other sailors .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While much of their time underway was spent on surveillance, anti-submarine and anti-surface ship warfare , the HAMPTON spent 70 days at the North Pole with a team of professors from Columbia University taking water samples for research being conducted on current and climate change .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So if you are of the mindset that submarines are all about undersea warfare or hunting the ""Red October"" ; think again .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modern attack subs are now doing everything from the weather change research to delivering special operators ashore on covert operations .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Initially, the outside observer may get the impression that the men of the HAMPTON live a difficult and isolated life onboard a windowless tube with little or no communication with the outside world .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  we quickly discovered that the crew thrived in this seemingly austere environment .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Through our conversations with them, we came to the realization that they live by the submarine mantra of ""steel ships, iron men (and women).""  The absence of windows and natural sunlight quickly became irrelevant as the ship's electronics and sophisticated sensors became their window to the outside world .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Much like an astronaut, submariners become travelers in another medium deep below the sea .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Any perceived isolation leads to a greater connection with their ""shipmates"" forming an everlasting bond amongst the crew .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After only one day underway, it became apparent to us that the submarine service is not for everyone -- not all men and women are able to overcome the supposed ""sacrifices"" many civilians associate with a life at sea .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  those individuals that successfully complete the demanding screening and training pipeline of a United States submariner , will have excellent advancement and future employment opportunities in both the military and civilian sectors .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Civilian employers are always looking to hire submariners for their technical acumen, leadership skill, and ability to operate under pressure .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Those individuals that choose to leave military service are often rewarded with high paying jobs and quickly adapt and excel in the civilian workforce (the military does retain a very high percentage of these highly skilled individuals with large bonuses, special pay and the intangible sense of patriotic duty that accompanies wearing the uniform of a Navy submariner) .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sir Winston Churchill once said , ""Of all the branches of men in the forces there is none which shows more devotion and faces grimmer perils than the submariners."" From our experience with the captain and crew of USS HAMPTON, we couldn't agree more .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Any danger of operating a ship under the sea was however quickly overshadowed by the competency of the sailors tasked with running America's most stealthy and vital warships .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've written two best-selling histories of the period .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The greatest social movement of the last century belongs to all Americans .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But some people prefer to play racial games .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This movie fits in with the racially divisive discussion about who owns the history of the civil rights movement .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It fits with polarizing racial figures like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They regularly exploit the history of the civil rights movement for their own personal gain  -- hosting television shows and getting money from corporations -- while not doing the hard work of addressing high rates of black crime, school dropouts and family breakdown .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is also fits with many white politicians who blame the poor for every problem and find it easy to push minority voters out of their districts while ignoring the nation's history of denying black people the right to vote .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now a version of the same race hustle is on display in Hollywood .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To celebrate King as a hero , the director , who is black decided to make President Lyndon Johnson into a white villain .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In one scene Johnson erupts in anger at Dr  King , telling the civil rights leader , ""You've got one big issue , I've got one hundred and one."" People who were in the room , black and white aides to the president and Dr  King, say no such confrontation ever happened .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The movie also has Johnson approving of FBI Director J  Edgar Hoover's scheme to send Dr  King's wife an audio recording of her husband having sex with another woman .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The historical record is clear .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, the tape is real .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No, Johnson had nothing to do it .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the tape had nothing to do with events in Selma .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All of that is what Bill Moyers called ""the worst kind of creative license suggesting the very opposite of the truth.""  And when the director, DuVernay, was called on the distortion , she said people who care about history are the problem .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She argued that crediting Johnson with supporting the Selma march was ""jaw-dropping and offensive"" and amounted to ignoring ""black citizens who made it so."" To her, the fact that Johnson explicitly endorsed the idea of taking the movement to Selma in a recorded phone call to Dr  King is just a nuisance .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
White directors have similarly distorted civil rights history .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The 1988 film ""Mississippi Burning"" featured two heroes, both white and both FBI agents .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That was an incredible distortion of a story about the bravery of civil rights workers who dared to go south to stand with beleaguered black heroes against racial oppression .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In truth, the FBI was often in league with local police departments in covering up racially motivated murder .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In 1988 that distortion was rationalized as a smart box office decision to offer white heroes to white audiences .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now that a black director has a chance to make Hollywood's first big movie about Dr  King , she sees it as time for payback and her own brand of distortion .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Race retains a powerful grip on American guilt, fear, lust and anger .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's why controlling the narrative is so important .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And the key to the narrative is in the facts of slavery, legal segregation and the fight for equal rights .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is why facts about Dr  King are subject to a constant power struggle .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DuVernay is saying she will tell her story as a black story for black audiences with a black hero , and she will twist facts as she pleases .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mark Twain said : ""Get your facts first , then you can distort them as much as you please.""  The facts are that mostly white students went south for Freedom Summer ; white ministers and rabbis took great risks and even died for the cause ; white government officials like John Doar and Nicholas Katzenbach put themselves between racist mobs and black people .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
None of this diminishes the contributions of black people .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The truth is that President Johnson worked to make the movement a success .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The president famously brought tears to Dr  King's eyes in 1965 when he told a joint session of Congress and a television audience of 70 million that every American should stand up for equal voting rights .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Their cause must be our cause, too,"" the president said .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Because it's not just Negroes , but it's really all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.""  And then , in a rhetorical crescendo, the president said : ""And we shall overcome."" He used a phrase that told the nation he was on the side of civil rights for black people .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the author of a history of the civil rights movement, ""Eyes on the Prize -- America's Civil Rights Years,"" I've done enough research to know that any fair account of the great social movement has to acknowledge Lyndon Baines Johnson as a civil rights hero .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were reporting all last week that the president was receiving daily updates and holding daily meetings about the North Korea cyber crisis .",par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seems implausible that could have slipped through the cracks .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So now the president says he'll weigh the options presented to him about what to do about North Korea .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"What is ""in"" our cellphones that would lead people to attack others or risk death to keep them?

Why else would so many people hesitate even to leave a room without taking their cellphones with them? Why would they interrupt meetings and family time to check them? Why would young people be opting to spend their money on newer, faster ones, instead of on clothing?  Why would there be so much interest in personalizing the sounds they make , the apps they hold and the cases that hold them?

"The annual Christmas parade in Piedmont, Alabama is a big deal in this small town tucked away in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Piedmont parade doesn't have giant helium-filled balloons or dancing Broadway show girls - but they do have the local high school marching band and Santa Claus parades down North Main Street on a bright red fire truck .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""We try to honor our kids and we try to give recognition to those who do well,"" Mayor Baker said .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We didn't think there would be any problems at all.""  Little did the mayor know that his town was about to be infested with an ill- tempered gaggle of atheists from Wisconsin - the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They alleged that a single person in Piedmont had complained about the parade theme - and the FFRF sent the mayor a threatening letter .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The theme ""alienates non-Christians and others in Piedmont who do not in fact have a 'strong belief in prayers' by turning them into political outsiders in their own community,"" FFRF attorney Andrew Seidel wrote .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The sentiment of 'Keeping Christ in Christmas' does not qualify as a secular celebration.""  They told the city to find a ""more appropriate, more inclusive, and constitutional theme"" for the parade .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not the first time that the perpetually offended atheists have targeted Piedmont .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Earlier this year, they demanded that the local high school stop reciting prayers before football games .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Somebody filed a complaint and we had to stop that,"" the mayor said .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well , to be accurate - they sort of stopped praying .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""And as citizens, we recited the Lord's Prayer - out loud,"" Mayor Baker said .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""One week we had the entire football field encircled by people .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was really wonderful and very moving to me to see people come together and praise God and speak His name out loud.""  The prayer controversy was one of the reasons why the parade committee wanted to make a statement during the Christmas parade .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unfortunately, the city attorney told the mayor that the theme violated the law - there was nothing they could do .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the folks around Piedmont are not the kind of folks who back away from a fight .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're a pretty resourceful bunch .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While they agreed to not officially have a parade theme - the city has decided to keep Christ in Christmas in other ways .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""It's a positive march - it's not a protest march .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""I appreciate all the citizens who got on Facebook and the telephone and talked to each other .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been many World War II stories told in film depicting triumphs of personal courage and survival .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The story of Louis Zamperini is one such story, but with an added dimension .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zamperini , who died earlier this year at age 97 , came home an angry man .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He became addicted to alcohol and cigarettes and verbally abused his young wife as he wrestled with his inner demons .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The skeleton of his story is in the film -- the plane crash at sea while on a rescue mission; the 47 days floating on a raft before being picked up by a Japanese ship and thrown into a prison camp ; the relentless torture and eventual liberation at the end of the war .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After returning to Los Angeles we see Zamperini hugging his brother and parents , but the story ends there .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Director Angelina Jolie attempts to put some flesh on the bones at the end of the film with some still shots and words that tell us that Zamperini's faith led him to return to Japan on a personal mission of reconciliation .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In media appearances, Jolie has refused to discuss why the most remarkable part of Zamperini's story was excluded from the film .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That would be the night he was converted at the 1949 Billy Graham crusade in Los Angeles .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Hillenbrand tells it in her book , Louis came home, poured his alcohol down the drain, threw out his cigarettes, was reconciled to his wife and became a new man because , he said , he had asked Jesus Christ to be his savior .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As stories about faith have made a recent comeback on TV and in movies , attracting high ratings and large ticket sales at the box office , it is puzzling why Jolie , who directed the film, and the Coen brothers , who wrote it , left out the most important part of Zamperini's story .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Once word gets around that Zamperini's conversion , which was so faithfully and beautifully chronicled in Hillenbrand's book , is not in the film , I suspect many who share Louis' faith will not buy tickets .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Apologists for Universal Pictures say people can always read the rest of the story in the book .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, they can, but then why should they see a film that highlights only half a life?  Just before he died , Jolie showed Zamperini a rough cut of the film .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He professed to like it and said it doesn't force religion down people\'s throats .,testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's a cliche , which doesn't really fit in this instance .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nothing is ""forced"" when it is true .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The film, ""Selma,"" which is scheduled for release on January 9 , would be incomplete if it failed to depict Martin Luther King Jr  as a minister whose faith motivated him to be a modern-day Moses .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fortunately, in addition to Hillenbrand's book, people can read Louis\' story in his own words .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His book is titled , ""Don't Give Up , Don't Give In: Lessons from an Extraordinary Life."" The One who preserved his life to the end is more powerful than his Japanese prison camp abuser .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"But at the United Nations, 2014 wraps up with the adoption of twenty times more resolutions by the General Assembly condemning the state of Israel for violating human rights than any other nation on earth .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is not one General Assembly resolution worried about human rights in China or Russia or Saudi Arabia or Yemen or Libya or Nigeria or Mexico - and so forth .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The General Assembly will even adopt one resolution critical of Syria but two resolutions demanding Israel immediately return the Golan Heights to Syria - the place where lucky Syrians and UN peacekeepers dash to Israel for protection .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The demonization of Israel, and the inequality of the self- determination of the Jewish people, by way of the United Nations have one painfully obvious purpose: the end of the Jewish state .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Palestinians have justifiable ""uprisings."" Israelis have ""extremists."" Arabs mount ""peace initiatives."" Israelis mount ""military operations.""

"It is entitled ""La Nakba: Exode et Expulsion des Palestiniens en 1948""  - meaning ""The Nakba : Exodus and Expulsion of the Palestinians in 1948."" The exhibit , which was a ""cultural activity"" requested by ""Palestine,"" required UN approval and facilitation .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to formal guidelines, it must have been approved at the highest levels - the Director- General, Michael M? ller of Denmark .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It includes the following astounding statements : ""The Palestinians failed to see why they should be made to pay for the Holocaust ... Acts of terrorism...by the Zionists led to the flight and expulsion of the native Arab Palestinian population .... Zionist representatives ... planned and implemented the ethnic purge."" ""The partition resolution violates fundamental principles of the UN Charter.""  The organizers shamelessly responded in a written handout to the rhetorical question : ""Why did we create this exhibition on the Nakba?"" Their answer : to reeducate those misinformed by ""German guilt"" and ""the mass media"" in order to appreciate that in 1948, Palestinians were ""robbed of their homeland and their property.""  Hiding in plain sight at the UN is the reason for the lack of peace between Israelis and Arabs - and it has nothing to do with 1967 and ""occupation."" For Palestinians and Arabs across the Middle East, Israel is one big settlement .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Palestinian representative Riyad Mansour openly told his U.N  audience on November 24, 2014 : ""Our people are suffering immense and growing hardships, all stemming from the grave injustice done to them in Al-Nakba of 1948 and thereafter.""

Could 2015 be the breakout year for the economy?  Last week we got very joyful news :.  All of this is good news as we ring in the new year .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the best may be yet to come .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So why is the economy finally shifting into a higher gear? This isn' t a story of government-directed growth or stimulus spending .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's the opposite : Washington's role in the economy is starting to shrink after years of Obama administration activism .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The private sector is starting to take over .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The growth was propelled by a big rise in business investment, up nearly 9 percent; personal consumption, up 3.2 percent; and exports, up 4.5 percent .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Government spending , which is a negative for the economy , grew by 4.4 percent, thanks to a big rise in military spending , but domestic spending is still restrained .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The news was so good that even the threat that the Fed will now have an excuse to raise interest rates hasn't deterred the bulls on Wall Street .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Here is the case for optimism going forward .,other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  a huge factor in the economic rebound has been the fall in energy costs .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the price of oil has fallen from $105 a barrel this summer to closer $70 by September , (and at the end of December it was at $53) the cost of oil imports has tumbled .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Imports fell by nearly 2 percent , and this alone added almost 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even that greatly understates the economic windfall from cheap energy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Production costs fall when energy costs do , so the supply of American-produced non-oil and gas products, such as manufactured goods, rises when gas is cheap .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gas prices should continue to fall , the good-news story rolls on , and the addition to GDP from energy should be even higher .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thank you, Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota .",other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And thank you , fracking .",other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second , businesses are clearly feeling less trepidation about investing , and some of the wet blanket of Obama's anti-business, anti-shareholder agenda has dissipated as the Republican Congress repels his worst ideas: cap-and-trade, minimum wage hikes, new taxes on the energy industry and massive new spending initiatives out of Washington .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gridlock now looks to be built into the political system for the next two years, and in many ways that's reassuring .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Third ,  government spending has fallen a lot more than people think .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the boost in military spending in the last quarter, the biggest story of the U.S  economy over the last three years has been the retrenchment of government spending .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Federal spending has fallen from 24.4 percent of GDP in 2009 and 23.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to 21 percent of GDP in 2014 .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even better news is that in the fourth quarter of 2014, federal spending as a share of GDP fell to below 20 percent, according to a new analysis by Dan Clifton of Strategas, an economic policy consulting firm .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is creating an anti-Keynesian boost to growth , because the government is taking fewer private sector resources each month .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 4 percentage points less of GDP that the government is spending means 4 percent more GDP for private businesses and families to spend .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's close to $700 billion a year more for private investment and construction and spending .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This, by the way, shows the foolhardiness of the Keynesian notion of a government-spending free lunch .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Five years ago the Obama economics team was talking about multiplier effects from higher federal outlays  -- the stimulus bill spent $830 billion -- that would juice the economy with even more private spending .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It never happened .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even President Obama's own economic analysis found the economy grew more slowly than it would have without the government debt- financed spending .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The real effect of government spending is to crowd out private spending .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A final reason for optimism is that the incoming class of Republican governors and conservative state legislators across the country should mean more growth policies coming out of state capitals .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At least a dozen governors from Massachusetts to Illinois to Tennessee are talking about tax cuts to create jobs .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Skeptics will say that Obama's executive actions on climate change, immigration, energy policy and so on will continue to be a restraint on growth .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's for sure .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This recovery from recession is still nearly $2 trillion behind where we should would be if we had a Reagan-paced boom .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is still one of the most anemic recoveries , though it is belatedly picking up steam .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's also true that wages are still flat for most workers , so the big challenge for the economy is raising productivity so Americans get a well - deserved pay raise .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is increasingly apparent that the U.S  war against Islamic extremism has been put on hold by President Obama and his national security team .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
President Obama failed to even mention Al Qaeda during his State of the Union address .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In early January, the recent terrorist attacks in Paris against the Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket gave us a glimpse of what the future of terrorism looks like , and what the civilized world will have to defend against .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the same time ,  the unfolding chaos in Yemen and loss of a U.S  partner in the fight against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) raises serious concerns about the future of a country that four months ago President Obama cited as a successful model for U.S.-led efforts to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ISIL and AQAP are two faces of the same enemy, radical violent Islam , which is on the march around the world .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2013, ISIL was confined to Syria and Iraq .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the Syria civil war dragged on, and in the absence of early, forceful intervention on the part of the United States or European nations , the chaotic situation spread to Iraq , where weak security services were no match for an emboldened terrorist army .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2014 , global support to the Islamic State blossomed as it began to supplant likeminded terrorist groups , and the Islamic State counted affiliates in Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ISIL even has begun to make inroads in Yemen , where the United States has been involved in efforts to degrade AQAP's capabilities , but have been unable to eliminate AQAP's ability to conduct attacks on us and our allies .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AQAP remains one of the most pressing security threats America currently faces as the recent attacks in Paris show .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the wake of the Paris attacks and plots disrupted elsewhere in Europe, European capitals are rightfully defiant in the face of terror .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But without a change in our strategy, the task of defending against the triple threat of home grown extremism , jihadists who have easy access to hotbeds of radicalization in places like Yemen and Syria , and the expansion of the Islamic State, will be nearly impossible .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Islamic State continues to recruit extremists in Europe, the Middle East, and as far away as southeast Asia , using targeted, high quality videos, magazines and literature copied in several languages to spread their message around the world .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They trumpet their successes on the battlefield, and try to portray a welcoming environment centered on family and Islam as a means to attract terrorists and their families as subjects of their caliphate .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The United States and all civilized countries need to coordinate our efforts to fight the Islamic State first by cutting them off .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We must counter their message on social media ; bolster allies like Iraq and Jordan ; and ensure that we prevent suspected terrorists from traveling back and forth between their homelands and places like Syria, Libya, and Yemen .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps most importantly, we have to help governments eliminate the safe havens that the Islamic State relies on to gather strength .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Syria, Yemen, and Libya are all examples of our failure to learn one of the fundamental lessons of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 -- that failed and failing states breed instability and are potential safe havens for terrorists who will eventually turn their attention toward us .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also cannot afford to ignore another lesson of 9/11 and curtail intelligence gathering capabilities that have been legally and painstakingly established following those horrific attacks .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The U.S  government should implore American technology companies to cooperate with authorities so that we can better track terrorist activity and monitor terrorist communications as we face the increasing challenge of homegrown terrorists radicalized by little more than what they see on the Internet .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This year, a new Republican majority in both houses of Congress will have to extend current authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , and I urge my colleagues to consider a permanent extension of the counterterrorism tools our intelligence community relies on to keep the American people safe .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The challenge we face as free societies is unlike anything we have seen in recent decades .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As we look at this moment in the long war against terrorism , it is encouraging to see Europeans aggressively moving to defend the continent following a horrific attack .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But one need look no further than the setbacks in Yemen and the stalemate in Syria and Iraq to see the limitations of President Obama's current strategy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lofty speeches and half measures do not defeat terrorist groups .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also do not keep Americans safe in the long term .,common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We all know who it is .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And ,  frankly, most of us French people would have preferred to have President Obama or any other senior U.S  government official rather than Ahmed Davutoglu, the Turkish Prime Minister, or Victor Orban, his Hungarian counterpart, or Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister - those hypocrites whose conception of ""freedom of expression"" is not exactly that of Voltaire .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is no good excuse for the U.S  physical absence (apart from the presence of Ambassador Jane Hartley , whose face is unknown to 99.99% of the French population) from last Sunday's march .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps the White House did not realize that it would be a historical event? But for most world leaders, the decision to be present in Paris was a last minute decision .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It would not not have been easy for the U.S  Secret Service to improvise the appropriate security measures? Well , if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could do it , don't tell us that Obama could not .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps the president did not want to support the Charlie Hebdo people because he believes that ""the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam"" (his words at the U.N  General Assembly in 2012)? Not a good excuse  - this was not about approving what the French cartoonists were doing , but showing solidarity in the face of terrorism .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obama missed an opportunity to present himself as the leader of the free world in front of the continued menace of jihadi terrorism ; but that is his loss .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The mere fact that his presence was apparently not even discussed in the the White House is a confirmation that this administration does not feel as close to Europe as others did in the past ; but we knew that already .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the end of the day, I'm not sure that it really matters to us French in the current context .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The debate after the march about Obama's absence became a debate in France only because it was one in the United States .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some in the French government have whispered that Obama's presence would have relegated President Hollande to the shadows .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But most importantly, we received such an outpouring of sympathy from our American friends, Democrats and Republicans alike , that we know the United States could feel our pain .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just as we felt America's pain after 9/11 .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition ,  there is absolutely no doubt that US-French cooperation on counterterrorism , which was already excellent , will be tightened even more .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Immediately after the attacks, Washington offered support from its intelligence services .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The White House has announced that it will convene a Summit on Counter-Extremism in February - that will be an opportunity to devise common strategies .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You get the idea .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In some ways we get better .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In some ways we get worse .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2014 was a year marked by greater division between groups of Americans than I can remember in my adult life .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Racial tensions resurfaced in violent protests following the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New York City's mayor and police split ranks over the mayor's comment that his biracial son faced perpetual danger from police officers, followed by the assassination of two New York City police officers .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The gap in wealth between the richer and poorer segments of Americans widened to record levels .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Democratic and Republican parties became more polarized -- with gun rights, immigration, abortion and health insurance leading people not only to argue the issues more vehemently with people from the other party, but to feel like they might have little in common with people from the other party, period .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whether one supports President Obama or not , I believe most people would agree our nation is more divided than it was when he took office .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"White and black Americans may have thought they were electing a black leader who could unite the country , and that seemed to point to an American future of unity and promise .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But something went horribly wrong .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To my eye, it was as if the president's own unhealed wounds were ripping open the wounds of our nation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So it makes me wonder : What do we Americans really have in common , whether black or white, rich or poor , young or old?  What should we remember about one another that could bind us together while aggressively arguing the political and social issues that threaten to pull us apart?  First ,  we are all human beings , which means we all suffer .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"None of us avoids pain , whether from trauma or loss , and just the chapters of our life stories in which we have felt powerless against loved ones falling ill, or falling ill ourselves, should remind us that we are all intensely vulnerable at all times .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our vulnerability means that we owe a duty of care to one another .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The universal capacity to hurt is only the flip side of our calling to compassion  -- which is closely aligned with our capacity to heal .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We should, therefore, debate vigorously, but with this in mind : There are very few issues that would keep us on grandstands or podiums or behind television cameras or microphones if , God forbid , we got a call from a doctor with very bad news about our health or -- far worse, in my mind -- the health of our children .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And think about this : How violent would protests be if protesters knew that a few dozen of the police officers standing guard in the streets had sick or disabled kids at home?  Second ,  I believe all human beings are born with the capacity for good .",par-sep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every single one .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No exceptions .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And I believe it is a profound tragedy when that capacity is not realized .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The loss of Michael Brown -- to the streets, or unwieldy forces in his psyche, or to a bullet -- is everyone's loss .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The loss of two New York City police officers -- to the twisted rage of a twisted man -- is everyone's loss .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Yes, we argue passionately about the future of America .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These things are inevitable .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They are even necessary when the stakes are freedom and the future .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But it might serve us well to remember that if every one of us can grieve and every one of us can suffer and every one of us is mortal and every one of us has the capacity for compassion and every one of us is an inextricable part of this whole we call America , that we are brothers and sisters , as surely as if we shared a single home, the same last name and the same skin .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let the arguments between us be both very loud and, yet, always, quietly loving .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The photos of 40 of the world's government leaders marching arm-in-arm along a Paris boulevard on Sunday with the president of the United States not among them was a provocative image that has fomented much debate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The march was, of course, in direct response to the murderous attacks on workers at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo by a pair of brothers named Kouachi, and on shoppers at a Paris kosher supermarket by one of the brothers' comrades .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The debate has been about whether President Obama should have been at the march .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The march was billed as a defense of freedom of speech in the West ; yet it hardly could have been held in a less free speech-friendly Western environment , and the debate over Obama's absence misses the point .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the post-World War II era, French governments have adopted a policy advanced upon them nearly 100 years ago by Woodrow Wilson .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He pioneered the modern idea that countries' constitutions don't limit governments ; they unleash them .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thus , even though the French Constitution guarantees freedom of speech , French governments treat speech as a gift from the government, not as a natural right of all persons , as our Constitution does .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The French government has prohibited speech it considers to be hateful and even made it criminal .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When the predecessor magazine to Charlie Hebdo once mocked the death of Charles de Gaulle , the French government shut it down -- permanently .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The theory of anti-hate speech laws is that hate speech often leads to violence , and violence demands police and thus the expenditure of public resources , and so the government can make it illegal to spout hatred in order to conserve its resources .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This attitude presumes , as Wilson did when he prosecuted folks for publicly singing German songs during World War I , that the government is the origin of free speech and can lawfully limit the speech it hates and fears .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It also presumes that all ideas are equal , and none is worthy of hatred .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When the massacres occurred last week in Paris , all three of the murderers knew that the police would be unarmed and so would be their victims .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was as if they were shooting fish in a barrel .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why is that? The answer lies in the same mentality that believes it can eradicate hate by regulating speech .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That mentality demands that government have a monopoly on violence, even violence against evil .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, to those who embrace this dreadful theory , the great loss in Paris last week was not human life , which is a gift from God ; it was free speech , which is a gift from the state .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hence the French government , which seems not to care about innocent life, instead of addressing these massacres as crimes against innocent people , proclaimed the massacres crimes against the freedom of speech .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Would the French government have reacted similarly if the murderers had killed workers at an ammunition factory, instead of at a satirical magazine?  And how hypocritical was it of the French government to claim it defends free speech! In France, you can go to jail if you publicly express hatred for a group whose members may be defined generally by characteristics of birth , such as gender, age, race, place of origin or religion .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can also go to jail for using speech to defy the government .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arrested for speech at a march in support of free speech? Yes .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What's going on here? What's going on in France , and what might be the future in America , is the government defending the speech with which it agrees and punishing the speech with which it disagrees .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What's going on is the assault by some in radical Islam not on speech, but on vulnerable innocents in their everyday lives in order to intimidate their governments .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What's going on is the deployment of 90,000 French troops to catch and kill three murderers because the government does not trust the local police to use guns to keep the streets safe or private persons to use guns to defend their own lives .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why do some in radical Islam kill innocents in the West in order to affect the policies of Western governments? Might it be because the fruitless Western invasion of Iraq killed 650,000 persons , most of whom were innocent civilians? Might it be because that invasion brought al-Qaida to the region and spawned ISIS? Might it be because Obama has killed more innocent civilians in the Middle East with his drones than were killed by the planes in the U.S  on 9/11?  Might it be because our spies are listening to us, rather than to those who pose real dangers?  What does all this have to do with freedom of speech? Nothing  -- unless you believe the French government .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Often, the result is a thuggish attitude, including dressing like convicts with their pants falling down because the jail guards have taken away their belts .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Another consequence of civil rights leaders' failure to challenge criminal behavior in black neighborhoods is the angry, defiant interactions between those black teenagers and the police .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Once the black violence leads to death, especially if it is beyond the streets of a poor black neighborhood , there is no mercy .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The broken justice system that gives police a pass for killing an unarmed black teen is hard evidence that Americans, middle-class blacks and whites, think classifying young black men as an ongoing threat to public safety is not racial stereotyping .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And the police and grand jurors see physically large black men -- in the cases of both Michael Brown and New York's Eric Garner , who was choked to death by police -- as especially threatening .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How else do you explain the lack of human compassion by the police for Garner as he complained , ""I can't breathe""? How else do you understand two grand juries deciding there is nothing wrong with two people being killed by the police, agents of the government , if the value of their lives is equal to every other citizen's life?  In Garner's case, the police were videotaped choking him even though he never fought with them .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And the grand jurors still refused to allow the police to go on trial .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mandatory body cameras for police are a good idea , but they are not a panacea for the troubled relationship between the larger society and the broken black families, the poorly educated black children and the steady violence in poor black American communities .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Recall that Garner's death at the hands of the police is on videotape , and it made no difference in the grand jury's decision not to indict the police .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even with the video , what the prosecutor and the grand jurors saw in Garner was not a fellow citizen being hurt , but a troubling social reality .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They saw a potential threat to themselves in a big black man hustling on the street , even if this was a middle-aged man with no violent intent who was violating only a minor law by selling loose cigarettes .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Garner and Brown are in their graves , but the body count continues as poor black teenagers, especially boys, march from single-parent homes to bad schools, to jails and to wasted lives .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It begins with acting out in defiance of a larger society that ignores them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sometimes there are displays of anger that are seen as threatening , and they end up killing each other .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other times there are confrontations with the police that end with the boys in jail or the grave .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Under the individual mandate required by the president's new health care law, Americans for the first time must pay the higher of two penalties if they are uninsured and did not enroll in ObamaCare last year -- either $95 per adult and $47.50 per child under 18, or 1 percent of their yearly household income above the $10,000 tax filing threshold .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That means an individual earning $50,000 will face a penalty of $400 this year , and fines could reach up to $2,448 per person or up to $12,240 for a family of five .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unfortunately, these penalty rates will only continue to climb .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No American should be forced into the president's one-size-fits-all health care mandate .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Health care should be based on the fundamental principle of freedom , and Americans should be able to have the ability to make their own health care decisions without fear that the government will extract onerous penalties from them .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's why the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA interrogation and detention after 9/11 is important .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The executive summary of the report, written after reviewing hundreds of thousands of the CIA's internal documents , shows that torture was more brutal and much less fruitful than the CIA claimed .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  the committee concluded that all the claims about the value of intelligence gained from ""enhanced"" interrogation--including the claim that it helped the U.S  find Usama bin Laden -- are overstated or just plain false .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Proponents of torture are contesting these well-documented findings .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So let's look at the facts .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On 9/11, the CIA had few, if any, experienced counterterrorism interrogators .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their traditional purview had been intelligence collection during the Cold War .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inexperienced in this area and overwhelmed they resorted to techniques that merely sounded good but in fact worked against them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When concocting the legal opinions to authorize torture , the lawyers inside our government didn't consult trained interviewers or interrogation experts--the people who actually knew how to get information .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They consulted psychologists who helped train U.S  military pilots to resist torture methods should they be captured (torture methods , it should be noted , designed to elicit false confessions) .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If they had consulted trained interviewers , they would have found out what I and my colleagues had known for decades : Torture isn't just unnecessary ; it's an unreliable way to get information .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead , as the Senate report shows , the CIA brought in untrained interrogators and contractors and asked them to get answers out of Al Qaeda detainees using methods designed to inflict pain , both physical and mental , and even simulate death .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The CIA also employed horrific methods, like forced rectal feedings , that were never approved .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I recall when I learned that cruel techniques were being used .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I spoke with several long-term CIA officers and CIA polygraph experts with whom I had worked over many years , and we were all appalled , not just by its immorality , but because we knew it would be counterproductive .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Apologists say that these methods were used to put the detainees into a state of ""learned helplessness,"" in which the detainee would depend totally on his captor and give up all information .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Those of us who have actually conducted interviews know that this isn't the way things work .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To get good, accurate information , you want the subject to be as cognizant as possible .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You want him to be able to remember all the details and to be able to tell you them .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A person will say anything to try to stop the pain , and torture impairs the suspect's ability to remember the details that may be essential to your investigation .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Professionals don't need to use torture and never have .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On top of that, torture is illegal, both here in the U.S  and internationally .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The United States has even prosecuted people for the methods that the CIA used after 9/11 .,anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We are a nation of laws , and the conduct detailed in the Senate report is against the law .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For these reasons, in October, I joined 22 other security, interrogation and interviewing experts to issue a statement of principles in opposition to using torture .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not only is torture less reliable, illegal and immoral , we write , but it also makes our nation less safe .",testimony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When we are not using effective and legal interviewing tactics , we miss information that may be vital to our nation's safety .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In using torture , we also encourage other nations and actors (including terrorist groups) to emulate our illegal actions , effectively lowering the bar for the rest of the world , and allow them to use U.S  torture as a recruiting tool .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Obama, on his second day in office, signed an executive order banning the CIA torture methods the Senate report describes .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But this executive order could be overturned by a future president .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now that the Senate report's executive summary has been released and the public knows the just how ineffective and brutal U.S  torture was , we need to make sure that this prohibition is permanent .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Working with Congress to pass legislation that makes sure a ban on torture extends to the CIA is one way that President Obama can make sure that the United States never again embraces the misguided, ineffective, and dangerous tactics of torture .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In 2000, Americans gave just the opposite answer by a margin of 51 to 35 percent .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2013,[3] Sixty percent of gun owners listed ""Personal Safety/Protection"" as the reason for owning a gun .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Academic research aligns with current public opinion .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you have a gun in the home , that gun is far more likely to prevent murder than it is to be used in an accidental shooting or to kill a loved one .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Accidental gun deaths get a lot of press coverage , but the press is quite misleading when it talks about juvenile gun deaths .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  many news reports lump in young deaths involving gang fights .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These deaths are also tragic , but they have nothing to do with whether law-abiding citizens should own guns .",common-ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Centers for Disease Control reports that, in 2012, there were 58 accidental gun deaths involving children under the age of 15 .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More than 20 times as many children died due to accidental suffocation .,statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Pew Research Center survey found that 57 percent of Americans believe gun ownership ""protects people from becoming victims of crime."" Thirty-eight percent believe that it ""puts people's safety at risk."" Support for gun ownership has grown particularly sharply among blacks and women, with their support since 2012 rising by 25 and 11 percentage points respectively .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My research shows that since blacks are the most likely victims of violent crime , they are also the ones who benefit most from being able to defend themselves .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Women and the elderly are especially unlikely to be able to fend off a male attacker without the benefit of a firearm .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gary Kleck, Larry Southwick and other academics have shown that having a gun is by far the safest option when confronted by a criminal .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Police are extremely important in reducing crime .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  I have found that they are by far the single most important factor .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But police know that they almost always arrive on the crime scene after a crime has occurred , and because of that police are among the strongest supporters for private gun ownership .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"PoliceOne , which has a membership of about 450,000 active and retired police officers , found last year that 76 percent of its members believe legally armed citizens are either extremely or very important to stopping crime .",statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the proposed regulations have nothing to do with the tragedies .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even Mark Glaze , who was executive director of Bloomberg's Everytown For Gun Safety until earlier this year , conceded to the Wall Street Journal , ""Is it a messaging problem when a mass shooting happens and nothing that we have to offer would have stopped that mass shooting? Sure it's a challenge....""  Even worse for gun control advocates , people are realizing that regulations -- such as gun-free zones -- tend to encourage attacks by disarming law-abiding citizens instead of criminals .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hopefully, cities such as Washington, Los Angeles and New York will change their rules as more poor blacks and women recognize the benefits of gun ownership .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"One of us is pro-choice and the other is pro-life , but we both believe that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA) properly requires that pregnant employees like Peggy Young, a former UPS worker whose case is being heard by the U.S  Supreme Court , be treated the same as other workers who are similarly limited in their ability to perform certain tasks at work .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Passed in 1978 as an amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , the PDA expands the definition of sex discrimination to include pregnancy .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Its plain language makes clear that the test for a PDA claim is whether a pregnant woman receives the same treatment ""as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.""  In order to reinforce that the origin of the employees' limitation must not control , the 2014 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Guidelines further clarify that ""an employer may not refuse to treat a pregnant worker the same as other employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work by relying on a policy that makes distinctions based on the source of an employee's limitations.""  Both pro-life and pro-choice groups and members of Congress advocated for the passage of the PDA .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both sides agreed that employers should not be able to push a woman out of the workforce and potentially even into poverty based on pregnancy .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The PDA was meant to ensure that a pregnant woman should not have to choose between the health--or existence---of her pregnancy, and her ability to participate in, and derive economic stability for herself and her family from , the workplace .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Young's scenario is exactly that which the PDA sought to address .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Citing union restrictions , UPS refused to give a similar accommodation to Young .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result, Young and her family lost her pay and insurance benefits for the remainder of her pregnancy .",anecdote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We reject this treatment as not just illegal but immoral .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Though UPS recently changed their policy to add pregnant women to the list of those allowed to work light duty (the union did not in fact prevent UPS from changing its policy) , they still argue that the PDA does not require them to give this accommodation to Young .",assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is unacceptable .,assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
