1918398784,Assad regime launches operation in Latakia region attacks Syrian Turkmen village,"Published July 20 2015 A checkpoint that belonged to Assads forces is seen after a coalition of rebel groups called Jaish al Fateh said they took control of it on a highway that connects Aleppo to Latakia June 6 2015 (Reuters) Two people were killed and 15 injured as Syrian regime forces attacked the Avanl village of the Jabal al-Turkmen Mountain predominantly inhabited by Syrian Turkmens located in the northwestern Latakia province. According to Syria Turks Association tanks artillery and missiles were used in the attack and explosions were also heard in villages located on the Turkish side of the border. Four wounded were brought to hospitals in Turkeys Hatay province for treatment. The attack is a larger part of the operation as Syrian army announced on Sunday that it had stepped up air strikes and retaken villages in a new offensive on opposition forces in coastal province of Latakia. Aerial bombardment had intensified over the past 48 hours in a bid to cut rebel supply lines in rugged territory close to Turkeys border an army source was quoted as saying on state media. Latakia province - home to Syrias biggest port and a stronghold of President Bashar al Assads Alawite sect - has been a key battleground of the conflict which is now in its fifth year. Sunni Muslim groups including al Qaedas Syrian offshoot the Nusra Front control many villages in the borderlands north of the government-held Mediterranean port city of Latakia and other areas dominated by Alawites who follow an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The army said five villages and hilltops including Beit Khadour Beit Zaifa Tel alKhadar and Jabal al Rahmaliya had been wrested back from the insurgents bringing it closer to the border areas. The army had stepped up its campaign in the province since insurgents took the strategically located town of Jisr al Shughour in April strengthening their position in a mountain range that overlooks Alawite villages and close to Qardaha hometown of the Assad family. The area has been in control of opposition forces since September 2012. The rough terrain and heavy forests has allowed the opposition forces to resist heavy Syrian army shelling and withstand heavy aerial bombing defense analysts say. A Syrian army officer said the aim of the latest operation was to cut rebel supply lines from the Turkish border to the rebel held villages including the town of Salma that has been held by Nusra Front since 2012. ""These armed men are weaker than to try to dare get close to Latakia"" a senior army officer was quoted as saying in a report from the area by Lebanese Hezbollahs television al-Manars correspondent. Last year the Syrian army wrested back control of the Christian town border town of Kasab a gateway to Turkey nearer the coast in Latakia after less than three months of control by opposition forces including Nusra Front. The Syrian war has taken on a starkly sectarian character with the overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim rebels backed by Sunni Gulf Arab powers fighting to overthrow Assad who is backed by Shiite Iran.",dailysabah,against,0.026392962,1.0,0.249266862,0.002932551,0.008797654,0.0,0.029325513,0.023460411,0.168369983,1

President of the Syrian Coalition Anas Alabdah called upon the United Nations to take urgent action to protect civilians in Deir Ezzor who have been suffering injustices by the Assad regime and ISIS. Alabdah met earlier on Saturday with representatives of the Deir Ezzor Consultative Forum. Both sides discussed preparations for the forum due to be held in the Turkish city of Gaziantep on September 25 as well as its objectives and commitments to achieving the goals of the Syrian revolution. Alabdah explained that the Syrian Coalition will prioritize the alleviation of the suffering of civilians in all Syrian provinces including residents of Deir Ezzor in its upcoming meetings most notably its General Assembly meeting to be held on Monday. Deir Ezzor city was the scene of bloody attacks during Eid al-Adha with Russia and the Assad regime bombing ISIS-held parts of the city and its countryside while ISIS bombed regime-held parts. ISIS published a grisly video showing the savage execution of 17 young men from the town of Altibni on the first day of Eid. Organizers of the forum said that it is aimed at utilizing the talents in Deir Ezzor serving the interests of its people and putting an end to the chaos plaguing the province especially after it almost completely fell to ISIS. The forum also seeks to serve as an umbrella bringing together representatives from across the civil and revolutionary spectrum in Deir Ezzor as a first and essential step towards stabilizing and rebuilding the province.

The so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militant group has executed 700 members of a tribe it has been battling in eastern Syria during the past two weeks the majority of them civilians a human rights monitoring group says. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which has tracked violence on all sides of the three-year-old conflict said on Saturday that reliable sources reported beheadings were used to execute many of the al-Sheitaat tribe which is from Deir al-Zour province. The conflict between ISIL and the al-Sheitaat tribe who number about 70000 flared after the militants took over two oil fields in July. Those who were executed are all al-Sheitaat Observatory director Rami Abdel-Rahman said by telephone from Britain. Some were arrested judged and killed. Straddling parts of Iraq and Syria ISIL has swept across northern Iraq in recent weeks pushing back Kurdish regional forces and driving tens of thousands of Muslims Christians and members of the Yazidi religious minority from their homes. The insurgents are also tightening their grip in parts of Syria of which they now control roughly a third mostly rural areas in the north and east. An activist in Deir al-Zour who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters that 300 men were executed in one day in the town of Ghraneij one of the three main towns of the al-Sheitaat tribal heartland when ISIL stormed the town earlier this week. Another opposition activist from Deir al-Zour said residents of al-Sheitaat towns had been given three days to leave. Civilians fleeing al-Sheitaat towns had either taken sanctuary in other villages or travelled to Iraq he said. More than 170000 people have been reportedly killed in Syrias conflict which pits overwhelmingly Takfiri militants against the Syrian government since March 2011.

1924058193,Death toll rises in Aleppo while British FM blames Russia,"Published October 12 2016 Activists say the death toll in rebel-held Aleppo in Syria continues to rise with at least 27 dead on Tuesday as the Assad forces push to weed out rebels. Russia meanwhile faces what Kremlin officials call Russophobia after British FM Johnson called public protests at its London embassy over airstrikes in Aleppo Casualties pile up in Syrias Aleppo controlled by rebels as the forces loyal to the Assad regime push to recapture it with the aid of Russian airstrikes. Russias assistance meanwhile continues to draw the ire of Europe with the latest salvo from British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson who called for ""picketing"" at the Russian embassy in London. At least 15 people were killed in fresh air strikes and artillery fire on rebel-held areas of Syrias Aleppo on Wednesday a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll was expected to rise due to the number of wounded that are in serious condition. The Britain-based monitor said among the areas hit in the bombardment was a market in the neighborhood of Fardos. The deaths come a day after Russia stepped up its air raids on east Aleppo in support of an army operation to recapture the rebel-held sector of the city. The Tuesday raids killed at least 27 people among them four children in several districts including Fardos according to the Observatory. Four people were also killed and 14 wounded during rebel fire in government-held west Aleppo on Tuesday. Among those who survived the Tuesday strikes in the district of Fardos was 13-year-old Jameel Mustafa Habbush who was dug out of the rubble in a four-hour operation by the White Helmets rescue workers. An AFP photographer at the scene said rescuers heard Habbush shouting from under the rubble and began digging towards him. As they worked to free him they administered oxygen clamping a mask to his face as he emerged from the debris. His father and younger brother were reportedly killed in the attack and his mother was taken to hospital with serious injuries. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the conflict that began with anti-government protests in March 2011. In late September the army announced an operation to recapture the rebel-held east Aleppo after the collapse of a short-lived truce. Since then more than 300 people have been killed in bombardments of rebel-held areas according to the Observatory. British foreign minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday called for anti-war campaigners to protest outside the Russian embassy in London during a parliamentary debate on the bombing of Aleppo in Syria. ""Id certainly like to see demonstrations outside the Russian embassy"" Johnson told MPs in the parliament. Johnson the former mayor of London known for his many public gaffes said the ""wells of outrage are growing exhausted"" and anti-war groups were not expressing sufficient outrage at the conflict in Aleppo. ""Where is the Stop the War Coalition at the moment? Where are they?"" he said. The Stop the War group was co-founded by current opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to protest against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It brought millions of Britons into the streets to protest against the build-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. During Tuesdays debate in parliament several lawmakers accused Russia of committing war crimes in Syria. Johnson was responding to a question from Labour member of parliament Ann Clwyd who called for protests by millions of people outside Russian embassies worldwide. ""I would therefore call once again on everyone who cares about the plight of Syrian civilians to picket the Russian embassy in London and in capitals around the world from today"" she said. ""Two million three million four million people. It can be done. It has been done in the past."" Andrew Mitchell a former international development minister said British aircraft could help enforce a no-fly zone to prevent Russian bombing raids. ""The international community has an avowed responsibility to protect and that protection must be exerted"" the member of parliament from Prime Minister Theresa Mays governing Conservative Party said. ""If that means confronting Russian airpower defensively on behalf of the innocent people on the ground who we are trying to protect then we should do that."" Mitchell compared Russias actions to those of Nazi forces during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. Russia has been waging a punishing aerial bombing campaign in Syria for more than a year in support of President Bashar al-Assads forces part of a multi-front war that has claimed some 300000 lives and seen Moscow further estranged from the West. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday cancelled a visit to France in a furious row over Moscows role in the Syrian conflict. The announcement from the Kremlin came a day after French President Francois Hollande said Syrian forces had committed a ""war crime"" in the battered city of Aleppo with the support of Russian air strikes. Moscow yesterday hit out at Johnson for accusing Russia of committing war crimes in Syria dismissing his comments as ""Russophobic hysteria."" Russian defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a statement that Johnsons ""accusing Russia of all mortal sins"" was just a ""storm in a teacup."" ""The Russophobic hysteria that is regularly fueled by certain members of the British establishment has not been taken seriously for a long time"" he said. Konashenkov said the Russian air force was not responsible for the bombing of a U.N. convoy in the Aleppo region last month and accused Britain of withholding the evidence it says it has against Russia. ""The alleged evidence you say you have wont be worth a penny if it is made available to everyone"" he said.

1926479178,Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Assad Regime Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks,Tuesday 04 April 2017 Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Assad Regime Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks. The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Assad regime accountable for the horrific crime his forces committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Chemical substances were used in the attack which left at least 100 people killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Assad regime committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Assad regime as a blessing for its actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. The Assad regimes air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. The Assad regime continues to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said. The Coalition called for the implementation of Article 21 of UN Security Council resolution 2118 which says the Council would take measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter in case of noncompliance including the transfer and use of chemical weapons.

1926479384,U.N. chief pushes Syria to allow for chemical attack probe,Friday 23 August 2013 U.N. chief pushes Syria to allow for chemical attack probe. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Friday renewed his push for Syria to allow U.N. inspectors immediate access to investigate allegations that the government carried out a deadly chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus. I can think of no good reason why any party either government or opposition forces - would decline this opportunity to get to the truth of the matter the U.N. chief told a diplomatic forum in Seoul. Syrias government has offered no public response to U.N. calls for its team to inspect the site of the attack which opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said killed from 500 to well over 1000 people. They said more bodies were being found in the wake of Wednesdays mysterious pre-dawn killer fumes which the Syrian government insists were not its doing. The administration of U.S. President Barack Obama said it was appalled by the death reports. A U.S. official familiar with initial intelligence assessments said the attack appeared to be the work of the Assad government. It was the regime acting as a regime the official said. But the Obama administration made clear that any response would await confirmation of a chemical attack and its origin. Images including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters showed scores of bodies laid out on floors with no visible signs of injury. Some had foam at the nose and mouth. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said world powers must respond with force if allegations that Syrias government was responsible for the deadliest chemical attack on civilians in a quarter-century prove true. But Fabius stressed there was no question of sending in troops on the ground. Talk of a forceful foreign response remains unlikely to be translated into rapid concerted action given division between the West and Russia at Wednesdays U.N. Security Council meeting and caution from Washington on Thursday. Moscow has said rebels may have released gas to discredit Assad and urged him to agree to a U.N. inspection. On Wednesday Russian objections to Western pressure on Syria saw the Security Council merely call in vague terms for clarity - a position increasingly frustrated Syrian rebels described as shameful. The State Department said senior U.S. and Russian diplomats would meet in The Hague next Wednesday to discuss ending Syrias civil war in what would be the first such meeting since allegations of the chemical attack. A senior State Department official said chemical weapons would also be discussed at the meeting. The meeting had previously been announced but no date had been released. Ban said he would send a top U.N. disarmament official Angela Kane to lobby the Syrian government in person and expected a swift positive answer. Obama has directed U.S. intelligence agencies to urgently help establish what caused the deaths a State Department spokeswoman said while acknowledging it may be difficult given that the United States does not have diplomatic relations with Syria. At this time right now we are unable to conclusively determine CW (chemical weapons) use the State Departments Jen Psaki told reporters. We are doing everything possible in our power to nail down the facts she added. Another U.S. official said intelligence agencies were not given a deadline and would take the time needed to reach a conclusion with confidence. Former weapons investigators say every hour matters. The longer it takes the easier it is for anybody who has used it to try to cover up said Demetrius Perricos who headed the U.N. team of weapons inspectors in Iraq in the 2000s. People are growing desperate Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents. Syrian officials have called allegations against their forces illogical and fabricated. They point to the timing of the attack days after U.N. inspectors arrived after months of argument and to previous assurances that if they possessed chemical weapons they would never use them against Syrians. After months of negotiating with Assads government to let inspectors into Syria a U.N. team arrived in Damascus four days ago. Their task is to check on the presence but not the sources of chemical weapons that are alleged to have been released in three specific small incidents several months ago. Many rebels and activists in the opposition area say they have lost interest in promises of U.N. investigations or in help from abroad: We are 7 km away just a five-minute car ride from where they are staying said activist Bara Abdelrahman. Were being exterminated with poison gas while they drink their coffee and sit inside their hotels. Qassem Saadeddine a commander and spokesman for the rebels Supreme Military Council said the group was still deliberating on how or if it should respond: People are growing desperate as they watch another round of political statements and U.N. meetings without any hope of action he told Reuters. Syrias revolt against four decades of Assad family rule has turned into a brutal civil war that has killed more than 100000people in 2-1/2 years and divided the Middle East along largely sectarian lines. Among world powers the conflict has revived Cold War-era East-West tensions and on the ground the struggle has limped to a poisonous stalemate. Assads Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shiite Islam and has the backing of Iran and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Western powers back the opposition but have been reluctant to fully commit to an Arab Sunni-backed revolt increasing layover taken by Islamists linked to al Qaeda. Yet they have said the large-scale use of widely banned chemical weapons would be a game changer. Syrias southern neighbor Israel still technically at war with Damascus said it believed Syrian forces had used chemical weapons and accused the world of turning a blind eye: The world condemns the world investigates the world pays lip service Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz said. In Paris Fabius said that if the Security Council could not make a decision one would have to be taken in other ways but he did not elaborate. Immediate international action is likely to be limited. European officials speaking on condition of anonymity said that options ranging from air strikes creating a no-fly zone or providing heavy weapons to some rebels were all still on the table - but that there was little prospect of concrete measures without U.S. backing which still seemed unlikely. The American reaction following yesterdays attack wascautious said one official. And without U.S. firepower theres little we can do.

Syrian air force bombers have pounded a major stronghold of the ISIL terrorist group in northern Syiran town of Raqqa reportedly killing at least 19 terrorists on the ground. Reporting the bombing of areas occupied by the Takfiri terrorist group on Sunday the opposition-linked Syrian Observatory for Human Rights further said the Syrian warplanes conducted more than a dozen airstrikes against ISIL position in the town over the past 24 hours. Director of the UK-based Observatory Rami Abdurrahman also stated that six of the Syrian air raids targeted Raqqas military court.

The latest developments come as Syrian army has achieved major victories in its battle against Takfiri groups across the country over the past months. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad says the Takfiri war in his country has strongly shifted in favor of government forces as they have made continuous gains in their fight against the terrorists. Syria has been gripped by deadly violence since March 2011. An estimated 170000 people have reportedly been killed and millions displaced due to the violence fueled by the Western-backed militants.

France and Britain said on Wednesday that United Nations inspectors currently in Syria should be allowed immediate access to the site of an alleged deadly chemical weapons attack. Syrias opposition accused government forces of gassing many hundreds of people - by one report as many as 1300 - in a pre-dawn attack on Wednesday.

""The number of Al-Nusra Front and rebel fighters killed in battles (Saturday) against ISIL in the strategic town of Markada in the south of Hasake province has risen to 39"" said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The group said ISIL lost 13 of its fighters as it took total control of Markada. ""Markada is important because it provides ISIL with a supply route from Iraq into the road linking Hasake to Deir Ezzor"" said the Observatory. Oil-rich Hasake and Deir Ezzor provinces border Iraq where ISIL has its roots. ISIL has been fighting a war against rebels including the Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front since January across large swathes of western northern and eastern Syria. Once allied to ISIL Syrias rebels and Al-Nusra turned against the jihadists angered by their quest for hegemony and abuses. While ISIL has withdrawn from much of the west and north of Syria it has held its ground firmly in the east near the Iraqi border. On another front fighting raged in flashpoints of Latakia province on the Mediterranean coastline where rebels and Al-Nusra Front began a surprise offensive against the army last week. Latakia is the heartland of both President Bashar al-Assads clan and his Alawite sect. Since late last week the rebels have taken over a key border crossing with Turkey at Kasab and a handful of villages. On Sunday the fighting was focused around the village of Qustul Maaf and the Nisr mountain which is surrounded by rebels.

1923848303,Bomb in Syrias Idlib kills 30 government fighters Monitoring group - Region - World - Ahram Online,"Bomb in Syrias Idlib kills 30 government fighters Monitoring group Reuters Tuesday 6 May 2014 About 30 Syrian government fighters were killed when rebels set off a bomb in a tunnel beneath a checkpoint in a northwestern province activists said on Tuesday. Videos and images posted by opposition supporters online showed a massive plume of smoke and earth shooting into the air near a small town as men shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). Rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad regularly carry out guerrilla attacks against his forces but the size of the blast which occurred on Monday was unusual. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said the blast took place outside the town of Maarat al-Numan in the northwestern Idlib province. At least two officers were among those killed when insurgents from the Islamic Front and the Shields of the Revolution Council set off tonnes of explosives in a tunnel running from the road to the checkpoint the group said. More than 150000 people have been killed in the three-year-old rebellion which started as a peaceful protest movement and turned into a civil war after a government crackdown. International powers have been deadlocked over how to resolve the conflict further complicated by infighting between rebel groups that has killed thousands of fighters this year. On Monday about 70 rebels were killed in clashes between a former al Qaeda affiliate the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al Qaedas Syrian branch the Nusra Front and its allies in an eastern province bordering Iraq the Observatory said. The fighting which has intensified in the last few weeks centres around villages on the outskirts of the city of Deir al-Zor capital of the oil-producing province of the same name where rebel groups have been fighting each other for control of oilfields and strategic areas. The latest clashes has displaced tens of thousands of people in the area over the last few days the Observatory said. Five civilians were killed in Mondays fighting which resulted in the Nusra Front and its allies taking control of the village of al-Sabha it said.",ahram,against,0.023041475,1.0,0.373271889,0.0,0.0,0.013824885,0.046082949000000005,0.032258065,0.038708785,0

The Syrian government has not commented on the bombing. The blast happened amid growing tension between militant groups over gaining more share of powers in the controlled areas in several Syrian cities. The Syrian opposition in exile said in a recent statement that the radical militants were trying to ""steal the (alleged) revolution"".

1926479389,Syria gas kills hundreds Security Council meets,August 21 2013 Syria gas kills hundreds Security Council meets. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrias opposition accused government forces of gassing hundreds of people on Wednesday by firing rockets that released deadly fumes over rebel-held Damascus suburbs killing men women and children as they slept. With the death toll estimated between 500 and 1300 what would be the worlds most lethal chemical weapons attack since the 1980s prompted an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in New York. The council did not explicitly demand a U.N. investigation of the incident although it said clarity was needed and welcomed U.N. chief Ban Ki-moons calls for a prompt investigation by the U.N. inspection team in Syria led by Ake Sellstrom. An earlier Western-drafted statement submitted to the council seen by Reuters was not approved. The final version of the statement was watered down to accommodate objections from Russia and China diplomats said. Moscow and Beijing have vetoed previous Western efforts to impose U.N. penalties on Assad. Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi said the allegations were illogical and fabricated. President Bashar al-Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces have used small amounts of sarin before hence the current U.N. visit. Immediate international action is likely to be limited with the divisions among major powers that have crippled efforts to quell 2 1/2 years of civil war still much in evidence. Russia backed up Syrian government denials by saying it looked like a rebel provocation to discredit Assad. Britain voiced the opposite view: I hope this will wake up some who have supported the Assad regime to realize its murderous and barbaric nature Foreign Secretary William Hague said on a visit to Paris. France Britain the United States and others called for an immediate on-site investigation by U.N. chemical weapons inspectors who arrived in the Syrian capital only this week. Moscow urging an objective inquiry said the very presence of that team suggested government forces were not to blame. U.S. President Barack Obama has made the use of chemical weapons by Assads forces a red line that in June triggered more U.S. aid to the rebels. But previous smaller and disputed cases of their deployment have not brought the all-out military intervention rebel leaders have sought to break a stalemate. U.S. Senator John McCain a Republican critic of Obamas Syria policy said on Twitter that failure to penalize previous gas attacks had emboldened Assad: No consequence for Assad using chemical weapons & crossing red line he said. We shouldnt be surprised hes using them again. Images including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters showed scores of bodies - some of them small children - laid on the floor of a clinic with no visible signs of injury. Some showed people with foam around their mouths. A boy who survived from what activists say is a gas attack cries as he takes shelter inside a mosque in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Mohamed Abdullah The United States and others said it had no independent confirmation that chemical weapons had been used. The U.N. chief Ban said the head of the inspection team in Damascus was already discussing the latest claims with the government. SLEEPING DEAD Opposition activists cited death tolls ranging from about 500 to - by one account - some 1300 after shells and rockets fell around 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Wednesday. In 1988 3000 to 5000 Iraqi Kurds were gassed by Saddam Husseins forces at Halabja. One man who said he had retrieved victims in the suburb of Erbin told Reuters: We would go into a house and everything was in its place. Every person was in their place. They were lying where they had been. They looked like they were asleep. Slideshow (21 Images) Doctors interviewed described symptoms they believe point to sarin gas one of the agents Western powers accuse Damascus of having in an undeclared chemical weapons stockpile. An opposition monitoring group citing figures compiled from clinics in the Damascus suburbs put the death toll at 494 with 90 percent killed by gas the rest by bombs and conventional arms. The rebel Syrian National Coalition said 650 people died. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar during a fierce pre-dawn bombardment by government forces. The Damascus Media Office said 150 bodies were counted in Hammouriya 100 in Kfar Batna 67 in Saqba 61 in Douma 76 in Mouadamiya and 40 in Erbin. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said: Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupils constricted cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims. Extensive amateur video and photographs appeared on the Internet showing victims choking some foaming at the mouth. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic. A voice-over said they were members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents.

1918150039,Thirty Killed in Syrian Strikes on Damascan Suburb Town,Posted on July 2 2016 by Asharq Al-Awsat English Thirty Killed in Syrian Strikes on Damascan Suburb Town Thirty civilians were killed on Saturday in intensive Syrian air strikes on a Damascan suburb town northeast of the city a day after the reported execution of a Syrian air force pilot a monitor and rebels said. The raids targeted a medical center a school and a residential area in Jayrud town rebels said. Jayrud is a heavily populated area that struck a local truce with the army that had saved it from the heavy bombing on other rebel held areas. It had made it a sanctuary for thousands of civilians fleeing heavy battles nearby. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said scores were also injured in the aerial strikes as well as shelling from army posts in the area. A rebel spokesman said the strikes seemed to be in retaliation for the killing of a Syrian air force pilot who parachuted down near the town after his plane crashed on Friday. The strikes against civilians are in retaliation against the execution of the pilot by Nusra Front said Said Seif al Qalamoni from the Free Syrian Armys (FSA) Shahid Ahmad Abdo brigade that operates in Jayrud alongside the al Qaedas Nusra Front and other groups. Rebels in a joint operations room targeted a main army base in the region with Russian-made surface to surface missiles after the aerial strikes al Qalamoni said. Syrian state media said the crash was due to a technical fault and the pilot had ejected while the rebel group Jaish al-Islam said it had shot down the plane but did not say how. Jaish al Islam said the pilot was arrested and was subsequently killed by a fighter from the Nusra Front while being held at a joint command center. The army had warned of a strong response after the execution of the pilot was reported shortly after he was shown on a rebel video circulated on social media giving details of his mission. Separately Russian and Syrian planes intensified their bombing on Saturday of a strategic rebel-held area of Aleppo that is near the only route into opposition-held parts of the northern city. If the Malah area were to fall to the army and its allies they would succeed in laying siege to areas where over 400000 people live under rebel control.

At least 15 civilians including three children have been killed in northern Syria in US airstrikes purportedly targeting ISIS positions in the Arab country a report says. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Wednesday that the attacks had occurred in the city of Manbij in Aleppo Province during the past 24 hours. The airstrikes came a day after the White house said the US government was following up on press reports about alleged Russian airstrikes in Syria with civilian casualties. The observatory and the Reuters news agency said on Tuesday that at least 23 people had been killed in Russian airstrikes in the militant-held city of Idlib including one near a hospital. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov denied the reports. We urge people to remain critical of any horror stories spread by the British tandem of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Reuters news agency he said. Elsewhere in northern Syria thousands of troops from a Kurdish-Arab alliance are launching an attack to capture from Daesh a crucial swathe of the region known as the Manbij pocket following weeks of quiet preparations US officials told Reuters. The Pentagon has reportedly deployed more than 200 special forces troops alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of Kurdish Arab Assyrian Armenian and Turkmen fighters. The Observatory said that the forces captured16 villages from Daesh and advanced to within nine miles on Manbij. Meanwhile Turkish military forces shelled northern Syria claiming to have targeted positions of the ISIS Takfiri terrorist group in the war-torn Arab country. The Turkish General Staff said in a statement on Wednesday that at least 14 members of the terrorist group were killed during the shelling on the city of Aleppo. The state-run Anadolu Agency citing military officials said Wednesday the strikes destroyed a tank two mortar positions a building used as headquarters and three vehicles belonging to the terrorists. The report which could not be independently verified said the air raids came after Turkeys military had determined that Daesh militants were preparing to attack the Turkish territory from the region. Cross-border fire from Syria has claimed 21 lives and wounded dozens of others in the border town of Kilis south central Turkey this year. Turkey itself stands accused of supporting Takfiri militants in Syria. Al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front and other Takfiri terrorists hold most of the northwestern province of Idlib and parts of neighboring Aleppo province. On Sunday Associated Press said Nusra Front has used a March ceasefire to recruit thousands of militants including teenagers who had used the Turkish border to slip into Syria.

(TRT World and Agencies) The US military is investigating reports that at least 73 civilians mostly women and children were killed in air strikes early on Tuesday morning in the northern Syrian village of Tokhar part of the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. Near the Turkish-Syrian border many civilians had fled their houses to avoid the battles raging in the vicinity. They sought refuge in a clump of ""clay and adobe"" homes in the nearby village of Tokhar Amnesty International said. US-led air strikes targeted the group taking out many of the women children and families who sought shelter there. This is the largest instance of civilian casualties since the US-led coalition began its bombing campaign in Syria in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a monitoring group based in the UK reported that the air strikes mistakenly identified and targeted the civilians as DAESH terrorists. The incident comes after another report of a strike killing ""a woman with four of her children and an old man"" in a separate part of the same city on Sunday the Observatory said. Recently the SDF a US-backed group mainly consisting of YPG militants associated with the PKK terrorist organisation concentrated their forces upon the strategically important city in an attempt to seize it from DAESH which took Manbij in 2014. The Syrian civil war began in mid 2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al Assad and his regime were suppressed violently in the context of the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then the UN has estimated that nearly half of the countrys population has been forced to leave their homes and the death toll may be as high as 400000.
