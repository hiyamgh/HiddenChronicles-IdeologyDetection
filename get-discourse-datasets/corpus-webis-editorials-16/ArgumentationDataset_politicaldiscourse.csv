"On Thursday, the so-called London Conference on Afghanistan will convene .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of all the high-profile international conferences that have been held on Afghanistan over the years - in Bonn, Tokyo, and Istanbul - this comes at a crucial juncture .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the end of October, British forces lowered the flag at Camp Bastion - from where they had engaged in the most intense fighting the British army had seen since the Falklands War - and handed over the base to Afghan forces .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just over a month later, the Taliban mounted a 14-hour attack on the very same site , killing six Afghan soldiers .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To the north, in the capital Kabul, insurgents have pulled off a dozen attacks in the space of the last few weeks , striking at diplomats, NGOs, and US contractors .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What explains this spate of violence, and is it a portent for the future of Afghanistan?  The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a US-led group that includes NATO members and others , winds up its mission on New Year's Eve .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A slimmed-down force of 12,000 foreign troops - mostly American - will stay behind , and US President Barack Obama has authorised the US contingent to continue supporting Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) throughout 2015 , with all of these forces scheduled to leave by the end of 2016 .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US is not, therefore , leaving Afghanistan in the abrupt manner than it left Iraq in 2011 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But this is a time of dramatic change .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drastic effects on casualties .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For one thing ,  the ANSF are doing much of the fighting themselves, with drastic effects on casualties : over 9,000 Afghan troops have died since 2013, four times greater than the entire American death toll since 2001 .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Afghan police officers are suffering especially badly, with thousands being killed every month .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the political level, a new government of national unity, led by President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, has taken charge after Hamid Karzai's departure .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ghani is already reported to have opened backchannel talks with the Taliban , visiting both Pakistan and Beijing to seek their help in this effort , cancelling an earlier arms request from India, and even making a highly unorthodox visit to Pakistan's army headquarters , in recognition of Pakistan's long-standing support for the insurgents .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the ground, the overall picture is mixed .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This year, Taliban-initiated attacks are reported to have fallen by 25 percent , and ANSF mounted offensives four to five times more frequently than last year .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the same time , as political scientist Jason Lyall observed , the recently-concluded fighting season - from April to October - ""witnessed the appearance of large Taliban units on the battlefield"" for the first time, with a tenth of all Afghan districts seeing ""at least one major Taliban offensive"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lyall also notes reports of over 1,000 insurgents on the battlefield , ""numbers not seen since the Taliban's original push to capture Kabul during the 1992-96 civil war"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While we should take these reports with a pinch of salt - NATO commanders accuse their Afghan counterparts of exaggerating - they do point to a simple, stark fact : The insurgency is far from broken , and it will be able to pressure the Afghan state for years to come .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this context, the wave of insurgent attacks might be explained in several ways .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  these attacks might be intended to drive a wedge between the Afghan government and its foreign patrons , encouraging the latter to abandon their allies more quickly .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a Taliban spokesman put it bluntly : ""Our objective is to force the foreigners to flee Kabul . Before ,  the foreigners were visible in the provinces . Now that they have limited more of their activities to Kabul , we have also gone to Kabul to target them there."" To some extent, this has worked .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many aid agencies have pulled out their staff, and restricted their movements .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tarnished credibility .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second ,  the insurgents failed to seriously disrupt either round of this year's Afghan elections , as they had vowed to do , leaving their credibility somewhat tarnished .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prominent attacks - publicised with videos - redress this issue, and project strength at the end of a fighting season .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They might also be ways of strengthening the insurgency's bargaining position in advance of any peace talks that gain momentum over the next year .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Third , the insurgency is not a monolith , and different parts of the Taliban might be responsible for different attacks .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Haqqani Network, a semi- autonomous group with close ties to Pakistani intelligence, has proven most effective at projecting suicide bombings into Kabul .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Haqqanis were blamed for the most deadly atrocity of the past month, the bombing of a volleyball game in which over 50 Afghans were killed .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the past, moves towards dialogue between the Afghan government and the Taliban have been met with carefully targeted attacks intended less to strengthen bargaining positions than to disrupt such talks altogether .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whatever the explanation , Afghanistan faces an extremely test period .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although the presence of US forces provides a safety net throughout next year , things look more precarious after that .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"International funding commitments for Afghanistan currently run to 2017 , but that timeline had assumed the insurgency would lose steam by then , allowing ANSF to slim down .",common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If that isn't possible , the annual $4-6bn bill for the security forces is simply unsustainable .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This week's London Conference is an opportunity to secure much greater contributions from regional powers , who have the most at stake if Afghanistan does fall apart once more .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"China is, for instance, one of the world's largest economies, a direct neighbour of Afghanistan, and a significant investor there .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But if Beijing is unwilling to offer more than a meagre $327m - nearly half the amount Iran pledged in 2012, and far less than Japan or the EU - then how are western governments, with their attention directed to threats from Russia and ISIL , supposed to persuade their own public that, after a decade of war, Afghanistan must stay on financial life-support?",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The London Conference on Afghanistan will provide an opportunity for the government of Afghanistan to set out its commitment to reform,"" states the UK government's official webpage of the upcoming meeting between the new Afghan government and its international donors .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The conference is also an opportunity for the international community ""to reaffirm its long-term commitment to supporting Afghanistan's peaceful development"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the media hype, the London Conference is nothing more than a routine reunion, set by the 2012 Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF) .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As part of the agreement, donors pledged support and the Afghan government promised to implement reforms and curb corruption .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The upcoming meeting in the British capital, therefore, is the first in a series of exchanges that will be held every two years, at the ministerial level, between the Afghan and donor governments to assess progress and check TMAF's benchmarks .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Still ,  the December 4 conference has the potential to ease Afghanistan into a stable and increasingly self-sufficient future and render it a reliable global partner for ensuring peace and stability in the region and beyond .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To utilise this opportunity as more than a routine progress assessment requires a fundamental shift of attitude on both sides .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lack of concrete success in the military, economic development and governance efforts in post - Taliban Afghanistan needs to be sincerely examined and adjustments need to be made .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is multitude of examples in the international community's flawed, if not disingenuous, aid programmes and their monitoring in Afghanistan .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was hired by a US consultancy firm to map out the field and offer recommendations for the design of a multimillion dollar governance project .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My report and recommendations , it turned out , were too radical .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""We expected recommendations for cosmetic changes to the ongoing programmes,"" I was told .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The donor agency does not want to rock the boat.""  On another occasion, I was interviewed by a European consultant for his assessment of the first phase of a programme that had consistently been showcased as a ""success story"" by donors and the Afghan government .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In his three-day field trip to Kabul, he had held meetings with three embassies, the UN, the Afghan head of the implementing agency and me .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eagerly, I began to point to the flaws of the programme and offered suggestions for improvement .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also offered assistance for site visits .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Do n't waste your time and mine,"" the septuagenarian consultant told me .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The donor agency expects a rosy report highlighting only the positive.""  He further clarified that the decision to fund the second phase had already been made and it had more to do with international aid politics, than development logic .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Numbers provide an easy way to illustrate success , especially when seeking international aid budget approval from legislative bodies .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While figures indicating Afghanistan's progress towards development are impressive and could not have been achieved without generous international assistance , they conceal a lack of attention to quality .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
About 8 million Afghan children - including over 2.5 million girls - are now in school .,statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a figure cited regularly as an indication that the programmes are yielding tangible results .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fact that most of them graduate only half-literate is never revealed .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Here's another feel-good figure : More than 60 percent of the Afghan population now has access to healthcare facilities .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The fact that some of those facilities have only received a checkmark because merely a building was constructed and many are staffed only with a nurse, have no diagnostic technology and have terribly anaemic pharmaceutical offerings is often ignored .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Much has been written about the fact that a hefty portion of the aid money goes back to donor countries because of the donors' insistence to award contracts to their own citizens .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The contracts move hand to hand and finally local non-governmental agencies are hired to implement projects .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At this point , while at best one-quarter of the original funds remains to be spent on the actual project , quality is grossly compromised and monitoring becomes either too complex or irrelevant .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The international community has also created an indigenous vehicle for channelling portions of its assistance .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Under the guise of ""civil society"", hundreds of Afghan NGOs have been established since 2002 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This artificial civil society's lifeline is the donor community in Kabul .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Projects and funds are handed to them for implementation and as the closing of fiscal year in donor capitals approaches, generosity in disbursing funds, irrespective of the projects' logic, utility and cost increases .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where the funds go .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Granted that when international aid began to pour in , the Afghan state had very small , if any , capacity to absorb and spend it .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  after 13 years and millions of dollars spent on public sector capacity building, the bulk of the funds continue to be spent directly by donors and only a little over 20 percent is given to the Afghan government .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The parallel system and structures offering higher salaries paid in US dollars have lured much of the skilled Afghan human resources .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Afghan administration, thus, has to be grateful to donors for funding training workshops , while in the end, loses its best trained personnel to international organisations, consulting firms and embassies .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is often said that rampant Afghan corruption and lack of capacity would result in misuse and waste of donors' funds .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A mere review of reports published by the US oversight agency, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), reveals the depth and extent of waste, fraud and abuse of the direct US aid to Afghanistan just in reconstruction projects .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similar monitoring of most donors' direct aid will, no doubt, highlight comparable corruption and waste .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The government of former President Hamid Karzai admittedly failed to launch a genuine fight against corruption .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lack of capacity for a governance vision that would make optimum use of international aid was also a defect of the previous leadership .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"High-level appointments were based not on competence and commitment of individuals, but rather on political affiliations and compromises on the one hand, and submissiveness of a handful of ""yes sir"" entities on the other .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thus ,  both sides - donors and the Afghan government - went on for a decade playing a futile blame game , each accusing the other of corruption and insincerity .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now ,  on the eve of the London Conference, a new page has turned in Afghanistan's leadership and governance .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The level of optimism among ordinary Afghans is only comparable to the euphoria of the first weeks following the fall of the Taliban regime .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This renewed domestic hope and confidence in the new leadership must not be let to deflate .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although the new administration has not yet launched its overhauling programme , President Ashraf Ghani's vision and capacity is well known .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Donors at the London Conference must seize the chance and afford him confidence .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They must also adapt a fundamentally new approach to dispensing their generous assistance to Afghanistan .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A significant funnelling of international aid through the Afghan government (with oversight and accountability benchmarks), a shift of emphasis from quantity to quality, with particular focus on raising the quality of education and finally , a sincere commitment from both sides to the establishment of rule of law will ensure the stability and eventual self-reliance of Afghanistan .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"After 13 years of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the United States and a number of its NATO partners will start the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The number of NATO and US forces is reduced from 140,000 to 13,500  - most of them American - starting January 1 .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How will the new national unity government in Kabul weather the NATO drawdown, despite a resilient insurgency and intensified fighting?  There has been much speculation about the security transition in 2014 in Afghanistan .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2012, I wrote an Oped for the New York Times , warning that ""Kabul risks political meltdown"" .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many other analysts have also predicted a sombre year , particularly after the refusal of former President Hamid Karzai to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) with the US .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  for the time being, we were all proved wrong as the democratic process that began at the Bonn Conference in 2001 , survived , and the country was saved from the brink of a new civil war .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed we have achieved important strategic gains in the last few months , starting with the landmark peaceful transfer of political power from one democratically elected leader to another, for the first time in Afghanistan's history .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This milestone was made possible by the will of ordinary Afghan people , who twice braved the threat of violence imposed by the Taliban and came out en masse , voting for their candidates of choice .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile ,  the Taliban has tried hard to undermine the electoral process .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By confronting Afghan security forces in 16 different provinces , they wanted to gain significant territory , thus declaring themselves as an alternative governing force in the country .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nevertheless ,  the Afghan security forces have been able to hold ground and push back the insurgent offensives in almost all fronts , which has became a source of pride for the Afghan government and people .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This proved wrong skeptics who doubted the capacity of the Afghan security forces to defend their country , which has taken responsibility for security in many provinces since the start of the security transition in 2012 .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Following the inauguration of President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Abdullah Abdullah, the BSA was immediately signed, approved by an overwhelming majority of Afghan Members of Parliament .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to the BSA, the signing of the Status of Force Agreement (SOFA) between NATO and the new Afghan government has created a new momentum in the country , while ensuring continued military and financial assistance for the new government .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This has inherited an economic crisis, characterised by a fiscal gap resulting from the failures of the previous government .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Afghanistan's strategic gains are still contingent upon two important factors .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, there must be continued NATO support for the Afghan security forces .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is done by building the capacity of the forces ; providing adequate resources such as fire power and particularly air power ; assisting in intelligence gathering ; and logistics support .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Without the technical and financial support from the US and NATO countries, the Afghan security forces will not be able to sustain a high rate of casualties against the Taliban .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For instance in 2014, an additional 5,000 members of the Afghan security forces were killed either in direct fighting against the Taliban or because of terrorist attacks such as suicide and road side bombings .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondly, the government has the capacity to reform the security intuitions in order to reduce the level of corruption and eliminate political influence exercised by important power brokers .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The financing of the Afghan security forces are beyond the Afghan government's resources and is totally dependent on donors' contribution .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The government could make significant contributions by reducing costs .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This could be done through reducing corruption and improving management .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile ,  eliminating political influence in appointments of senior officials and promotion of officers could boost the morale of the security forces and increase their fighting capacity .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alas, despite tremendous strategic gains, the new National Unity Afghan government is struggling with key cabinet appointments, particularly in the security sector , which might have been caused by heavy political influence by power brokers .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  failures inherited from the previous government such as bad governance, corruption, nepotism and many other symptoms that have caused a growing popular resentment, remain a serious threat to the national unity government .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While people admit that improvements in the security and economic sectors require time , they will not tolerate any failure in fixing a dysfunctional government which has failed to address endemic corruption and a culture of impunity .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The inability of the new national unity government to implement a comprehensive reform agenda , could undermine the security transition .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is clear to us in Afghanistan that the donor countries will not tolerate anymore corruption and bad governance , which could weaken their financial commitments pledged during the NATO Summit in Wales .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Any reduction in funding for the Afghan government could negatively impact the Afghan security forces , while the Taliban will increase their offensive .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The biggest test for the security transition is ahead of us because the insurgents will further intensify their attacks in the beginning of next spring and we might see a Taliban surge next summer .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Afghan government has little time to prepare itself for the upcoming fighting season , which has impacted the US and NATO military missions in Afghanistan since 2001 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Afghan government has little time to prepare itself for the upcoming fighting season , which has impacted the US and NATO military missions in Afghanistan since 2001 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls has said that his country is now at war with radical Islam .,testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""It is a war against terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam, against everything that is aimed at breaking fraternity, freedom, solidarity,"" Valls said during a speech on Saturday in Evry, south of Paris .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What is ""radical Islam""? Is there such a thing? And how does this affect the ongoing US-led war on extremism - the most tangible form being ISIL who have controlled large segments of land and people in northern Iraq and eastern Syria?  Very few people know that in Islam there are two kinds of ""jihad"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The smaller jihad is the more known - namely the one which reflects the military struggle .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the greater jihad , which is less known , is the internal jihad - or struggle .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Few people also know that the Arabic word ""jihad"" is used throughout the Bible as well , although certainly not in the militaristic sense .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 Timothy 4:7 states : ""I have fought the good fight , I have finished the race , I have kept the faith."" The verse in Arabic uses the term ""jihad"" for the word ""fight"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So whether it is this struggle or the fight for a better world , the militaristic jihad is certainly not a monopoly for Islamists .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
World leaders have correctly pointed out that the fight against ISIL must be waged both on the military and ideological levels .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But we must be careful about the idea of conflating Islam with radicalism .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
People and ideas might be radical but to target a religion with radicalism adds insult to injury and shifts from the proper focus which is the individually created extremism .,common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We have heard and seen a lot of the former , but very little has been done to tackle the ideologies behind this extreme group .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The need to deal with the extreme thoughts connected to this movement was made clear by extremists who carried out the heinous attack against a French satirical newspaper; most likely because of the ideas it has espoused .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whenever violent acts take place , the natural response is to militarily obliterate the group or militia behind it .",common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There might be a good case for a military response but it would be a totally counterproductive effort if it is not accompanied by an equally strong ideological response .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It might be possible to kill the holders of some of these ideas but everyone knows that you can't kill ideas by using force .,common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extremist ideology must be tackled in a number of ways .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most important ideological response to extremism is the need to show that there are better and more effective ways to deal with the various issues that make extremism popular .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This includes the need to introduce real political reform in the countries that are of importance to the people that follow these extreme leaders .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It applies both to the Arab countries whose autocratic leadership has left a large sector of the public without any say in what happens to them .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But it also applies to the need to continue stemming racism and Islamophobia from many of the western countries where some homegrown terrorism seems to be gaining strength .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The issue is complicated by murderous acts like those committed in Paris , which tend to increase rather than decrease anti-Islamic sentiments .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to political changes that must be introduced , Arab and Muslim intellectuals and leaders must end their self-imposed silence and speak out clearly and unabashedly .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no reason to keep repeating that these actions are not a reflection of true Islam .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is needed is for writers and thinkers to produce concrete and practical thoughts and ideas that can be applicable to the 21st century .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today's Arab and Muslim youth need to find alternative role models and alternative ideas that they can adopt in this struggle of ideas that extremists are working tirelessly to defend - and to which the other side is only paying lip service .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One successful idea called takween (seen on the local Jordanian website, ammannet.net) has seen an increase in audience as reformed independent writers from various backgrounds (culture, media, women's issues and workers rights) are producing daily analysis that is the anti-thesis to ISIL's ideology .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The individual efforts by some intellectuals is to be supported but much more is necessary .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The anti-extremism military effort can't yield positive results if there isn't a combined change in how ruling governments conduct their affairs (especially on the economic empowerment front) , and how to tackle every one of the extremists' thoughts, ideas and practices .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The battle will be long and cumbersome but in order to win , all people of good will must work together to produce what is good and uplifting for a better future for all .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The battle will be long and cumbersome but in order to win , all people of good will must work together to produce what is good and uplifting for a better future for all .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many have simply lost faith in global climate negotiations summits such as COP 20 starting in Lima, Peru today .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But while the process has not delivered the climate action we need , I would argue that this year key things have changed and that we must continue to demand from our politicians that they listen and act and, by that, safeguard the future of next and current generations on this planet .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As nations start the latest global round of climate change negotiations in Lima, Peru today , it is easy to be cynical .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because in the 20 plus years that our governments have been meeting for global climate meetings , emissions have risen more than ever before .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This year is already predicted to be the warmest since records began .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And yet ,  this is a moment of opportunity .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because things are changing , really changing .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the climate movement, in the economy and in the politics of climate change .",no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today, the climate movement all over the world is reenergised .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The largest ever climate march in New York this September was a powerful symbol for the global rise of a movement that is stopping pipelines and coal plants as well as forcing renewable energy solutions all over the world .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In economics , too ,  we live in a different world : Cost-effective, sensible renewable energy solutions have made quantum leaps .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Renewables are the most economical solution for new power capacity in an ever-increasing number of countries .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One hundred percent of new power capacity added in the United States in August was renewable and countries such as Denmark and Germany are producing new ""clean electricity"" records almost every month .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
China is installing as much solar this year as the US has ever done .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bilateral agreement .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The recent bilateral agreement between China and the United States to cut pollution and drive cleaner energy sources is, in addition, a sign of changing politics .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many said that such an agreement was impossible , that it would not happen in our lifetimes .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And yet it did .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only a fool would argue that the action proposed by these two biggest polluters and biggest economies is enough .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is not enough , experts have already told us , to protect our planet from a potential three or four degree Celsius rise in global temperatures - with all the disastrous consequences that would have for us, our children, and our ecosystems .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the fact that the world's biggest emitters have come together moves us from a ""you go first"" mentality , that had paralysed global climate negotiations for years, to an ""I will act if you will act"" frame .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At Lima , others must now follow and our pressure must speed up the action .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because we need an agreement to tackle the climate crisis , which meets the needs of the many not the few .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because it is ordinary people living in flood and drought prone areas, dependent for their livelihoods on fishing, farming and forests, or living in cities engulfed by pollution or in housing that cannot protect them from storms or heat waves , who are bearing the brunt of our experiment with the world's climate .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The United Nations  - where every country has a voice, not matter how small, relatively poor or vulnerable - are still the only place where we can hope to secure action that takes full account of these peoples' rights .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At Lima, we need governments to make sure that the direction is right .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They need to agree a goal of ending carbon pollution and deliver renewable energy for all people on this planet by 2050 .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And in Lima, governments must agree to renew and review their targets every five years, starting in 2025 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not just to cut pollution, but to help the vulnerable adapt to climate change, and to support poorer countries to provide sustainable energy access for their populations .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Every government should already be preparing their ""intended nationally determined contribution"" - their offer towards the Paris deal .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before March 2015 we must see concrete, ambitious plans from each and every one of the world's polluting nations  - to phase out coal and nuclear power , to install solar and wind energy , to increase energy efficiency, to build cleaner and more livable cities, and to protect forests .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Lima, governments must agree to review whether these plans are enough to prevent climate chaos and whether the effort is shared fairly between richer and poorer nations before they meet again in Paris in December 2015 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New challenge .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More specifically, this new challenge to Armenia's traditional reliance on Russia is driven by two significant factors: tragedy and timing .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A tragedy first triggered this turnabout when a rogue Russian soldier killed an entire Armenian family , save for a six-month-old infant who later died of his stab wounds, in Gyumri, Armenia .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gyumri is the country's second-largest city and the host of the Russian military base .,common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That senseless act of random violence in the early morning hours of January 12, sparked an immediate and spontaneous outpouring of grief and mourning .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the initial shock and grief quickly turned to outrage , as Russian military officials seemed to take charge of the case with a heavy-handed disdain and disregard for local sensitivities .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That perception was only deepened when Armenian officials were slow to respond or react .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was this mishandling of the tragedy , even more than the murder itself, that then triggered a series of demonstrations and protests by local Armenians in Gyumri .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fearing that the Russian conscript would be moved from his detention within the Russian base and likely returned to Moscow , local residents demanded that the self-confessed soldier be turned over to Armenian authorities .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Calming tensions .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For its part , local Armenian officials and the prosecutor general scurried to calm tensions by first announcing that Armenian investigators were actively participating in the interrogation of the soldier , and then , once that did little to appease the protesters , vowed that the soldier would be tried in Armenia .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amid the Armenian officials' wrangling over the legal process of the case, the absence of any higher level Armenian officials, and the failure of the Armenian president to declare a day of mourning or even make a statement , only escalated the tension .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And days later , no Armenian official attended the funeral of the murdered family , thereby triggering a fresh wave of indignant protests in the city , that later spread to the capital, Yerevan .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The protests soon moved to the Russian consulate in Gyumri before culminating in a march on the Russian base as protesters broke through a police cordon to enter the base itself .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  there is a deeper context to this public anger .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  that family is only the latest victim in murders and shootings by Russian servicemen stationed at the Russian military base .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1999, two drunk Russian soldiers opened fire on a local market in the city , killing two and injuring dozens of others .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bad timing .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Against this backdrop, the tragedy has also raised renewed questions of base security, with outrage that the armed soldier who reportedly deserted his post triggered no notice or alarm by Russian military personnel at the base .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although this tragedy has prompted a new challenge to Armenian-Russian relations , it is also exacerbated by a second factor, timing .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The timing of this tragedy could not be much worse, for several reasons .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  in 2013 , in what many perceived as Russian pressure on its so-called ""strategic partner"" , Armenia was forced to scrap its planned free trade deal with the European Union in favour of joining the Russian-led Eurasian Union .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second ,  a steady supply of arms and advanced weapons systems to Azerbaijan from Russia has sowed further distrust .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And most recently, the negative impact on the Armenian economy from western sanctions imposed on Russia, evident in a sudden depreciation of the Armenian currency and reflected in a steep decline in remittances, has only revealed the asymmetry and lack of parity in Armenia's ""partnership"" with Russia .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In April 2009 , harrowing interviews with the 14 ""high-value detainees"", conducted by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, were leaked , and in August 2009 an internal CIA report from 2004 into the agency's detention and interrogation policies after 9/11 was released containing details of how one prisoner, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri (one of the three men waterboarded, along with Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Muhammad), was physically abused and threatened with a gun and power drill while hooded at a ""black site"" in Thailand .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The report states :.  In addition , ""sleep deprivation involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours"" , and although some ""experienced disturbing hallucinations"", in at least two cases the CIA continued its abuse .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These examples - and many more in the summary - demonstrate clearly the committee's conclusion that the interrogations ""were brutal and far worse than the CIA represented to policymakers and others"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps more importantly, however, the committee also concludes that torture was ""not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees"" , that the CIA made ""inaccurate claims"" about the ""effectiveness"" of the programme in an attempt to justify it and that it led to friction with other agencies that endangered national security, as well as providing false statements that led to costly and worthless wild goose chases .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The report also concludes that non-approved techniques were used widely , and that ""[a]t least 17 detainees were subjected to CIA enhanced interrogation techniques without authorisation from CIA headquarters"" , and that ""multiple detainees were subjected to techniques that were applied in ways that diverged from the specific authorisation , or were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques by interrogators who had not been authorised to use them"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The committee was also critical of the central role played by two contract psychologists from the SERE programme , even though neither of them ""had any experience as an interrogator, nor did either have specialised knowledge of al-Qaeda, a background in counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The committee also concluded that Steven Bradbury's numbers were wrong , and that the CIA ""detained at least 119 individuals , of whom at least 39 were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moreover ,  of these 119 ""at least 26 were wrongfully held and did not meet the detention standard"" in the still-secret Bush administration memorandum establishing the programme in September 2001 .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Incredibly, of the 20 examples most often used by the CIA to show how successful their torture programme was , all were determined to be fundamentally wrong or misleading .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Case in point : In their representations to the White House, National Security Council, Department of Justice, Congress and the American people, the CIA often referred to Abu Zubaydah as ""proof"" that those methods provided real, actionable intelligence that saved American lives .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There' s only one problem with that story .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It wasn't true .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to the SSCI report, the FBI actually obtained that information from Zubaydah through legal interrogation techniques between March and June 2002, and provided it to the CIA months before he was ever subjected to waterboarding or any other torture techniques .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to the FBI interrogators, they had developed a rapport with Zubaydah , who was cooperating with them .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fall of Mosul and the quick territorial expansion of ISIL in Iraq took some by surprise .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What contributed to ISIL's quick success was cooperation from local Sunni tribes and members of the traditionally secular and nationalist Baath party .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This seemingly counterintuitive alliance has its rationale and deep roots in history .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The successful cooperation between radical Islamist factions, Sunni tribes and representatives of the former ruling party - currently commanders of paramilitary groups - can be traced back to the policies of Saddam Hussein in the early 1980s , which aimed to foster closer ties between those espousing the ideas of political Islam and the Baath party .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The historical preconditions for the advent of Islamist ideas in Iraq and their eager adoption by Sunni resistance forces are clearly discernible in the strategy proposed at the time by the then Iraqi president .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1986, at a meeting with representatives of the pan-Arab national command - the supreme ideological body of the Baath Party - Saddam Hussein offered a ceasefire, or even an alliance, between the party and the Muslim Brotherhood movement in Egypt and Sudan .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In practice, for the first time in its history the militant and secular Baath party declared its readiness to cooperate with representatives of the so-called political Islam .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the same year, the Iraqi president also defined the difference between the ""democratic, national, pan-Arab state"" and the ""religious state"" proclaimed by the Muslim Brotherhood .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Following in the footsteps of the founding father of Arab nationalism and of the pan-Arab Baath party Michel Aflaq, Saddam clearly declared that he was not an atheist , but warned against any attempt to establish a religious party with an either Sunni or Shia bias .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Saddam's warning at the time was probably addressed at the Islamic Dawa party , which had a dominant role among the Shia community and was regarded as the main competitor of the Baath party .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The president also rejected the traditional Islamic system of justice and denounced Islamic law as an obsolete legal tradition .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was only after 1990s that Saddam decided to focus on relations with Islamic movements and publications dedicated to the topic began to appear in the media .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The conditions could not have been more favourable because the war with Iran had ended and the propaganda machine was busy painting a picture of Saddam as the indisputable victor , despite the enormous war-related losses .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1991, Iraq launched a new campaign , which Saddam described as ""the mother of all battles"" against the United States and its allies .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The president was yet again depicted as a hero in the confrontation between Muslims and western forces ; the inscription ""God is Great"" was added to the Iraqi flag , and the president promised that he would free Jerusalem .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An attempt was made to play down the failure of the campaign in Kuwait and the sanctions imposed by stepping up an openly pro-Islamic propaganda .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1993, under the weight of a crippling international embargo, the Iraqi president declared the beginning of the so-called religious campaign .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The goal was to gain control over religious sentiment among the Iraqi population , which was barely coping with the consequences of the two wars and the stringent sanctions .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last but not least, an attempt was made to reinvent and soften the image of the Baghdad regime as one that is pro-Islamic and, therefore, in conflict with the ""forces of Islam's enemies"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The regime undertook demonstrative moves such as closing night clubs and some restaurants and enforcing restrictions on alcohol sales .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A large scale Quran studying campaign was undertaken .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Senior Sunni and Shia clerics took advantage of the situation and attempted to further the interests of their respective communities , declaring open support for the line taken by the Iraqi leader .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1998, top-ranking party officials, including Vice President Izzat Ibrahim al- Douri, were openly demonstrating religious piety and devotion .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The period after 1993 ushered in a renewed mosque building effort .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1989, a new religious university was founded and named after Saddam .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The influence of radical Sunni teachings increasingly gained prominence in certain intellectual circles within Baghdad University .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While one group openly espoused extreme conservative views , which today can be described as Salafi beliefs , the other blended in with the Sunni theosophical tradition and was influenced by the teachings of the Naqshbandiyya Order .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to witness testimonies, both groups received financial and moral support from the same source - Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A member of the academic community has even alleged that the vice president's support came with the blessing of Saddam .,testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The spread of the new ideology that lay at the very heart of the religious campaign began to make inroads into the judicial system , with the incorporation of extreme and previously unknown punishments into the body of law .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By way of example, according to Decree No 59/1994 theft became punishable by amputation .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The events that are currently unfolding in Iraq warrant the conclusion that the advent of ISIL and its support from or collaboration with Iraqi Sunni structures would have been impossible without the historical preconditions outlined above having already been firmly set in place .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki failed to strike a reasonable balance between the interests of all ethnic and religious groups in the country by systematically marginalising the Sunni community .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another important reason is widespread corruption and the lack of a concept and strategy for the development of the country on the basis of the established constitutional order that is shared by all groups in society .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From 2003 to date, no Iraqi government has initiated and proposed an adequate policy for Sunni inclusion .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The programme for the de-Baathificaton of senior-ranking party officials (whose number some commentators put at more than 40,000) has resulted in many losing their livelihood .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to its affiliation with the party, approximately one-third of the Iraqi population was effectively marginalised .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scores of people - many of them young people, including officers in Saddam's army and former civil servants - have been stripped of the Baathist ideology that they previously espoused and that had dominated their social life .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This void has been filled by Islam .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since 2004, many Iraqi Sunnis have joined the ranks of the Iraqi resistance movement , which brings together a number of prominent groups under its banner, such as the Naqshbandiyya Army, Al-Awda, Al-Qiyada al-Amma li Jaysh Al-Iraq (General Command of the Iraqi Army), Munazzamat al-Tahrir al-Iraqiya (Iraqi Liberation Organisation), Kataib Salah ad-Din (Salah al-Din Brigades), etc .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the radical narrative so typical for purely Islamic organisations, those mentioned continue to rely on the propaganda postulates formerly employed by Saddam as cornerstones of their public rhetoric .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many an aficionado came to jazz through that classic album - a 32-minute-long composition organised around a four-note bass routine .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The manuscript for the album is one of the National Museum of American History's treasures ; the saxophone that Coltrane used to record the piece was recently gifted to the Smithsonian Museum ; and former US President Bill Clinton, a saxophonist and Coltrane fan, is said to have ""A Love Supreme"" set as the ringtone for when Hillary calls .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The recording has long been understood to be a deeply spiritual, even devotional, piece .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All praise belongs to God .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  what was the nature of that ""spiritual awakening""? The conventional view is that by 1964, Coltrane had moved away from his Methodist upbringing , adopting a ""pan-religious"" outlook with a particular interest in Eastern mysticism .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In spite of that , ""A Love Supreme"" is still described as laden with Biblical symbolism: the title ""Psalm"" , and the rising cadences, reminiscent of black preachers' style, are offered as evidence that Coltrane was still rooted in Christianity .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But ask one of the jazzmen or Muslim elders who knew Coltrane , and you get a different answer .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This phrase has the semantics of the al-Fatiha , which is the first chapter or sura of the Holy Quran .",common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Arabic transliteration is 'al-Humdulilah ...' Since all faithful Muslims say the al-Fatiha five times a day or more , it is reasonable to assume that John heard this phrase from [his Muslim wife] Sister Naima many times.""  Lateef is referring to the poem Coltrane wrote and included in the liner notes of the album .",common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Coltrane wrote : ""No matter what ... It is with God . He is gracious and merciful"" and ends with ""All praise to God...""  What Lateef and others have noted is that ""gracious and merciful"" is a translation of ""rahman raheem"", the opening lines of the Fatiha .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even Coltrane's band members have pondered his relationship to Islam .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"That inspired me to write the basic chords, the line, 'Everyone around the world, come on, celebration'.""  This song inspired by Islam - and released in 1980 - would become an international hit heard at ball games and political rallies in the US , and ironically was played by the Reagan administration on February 7, 1981 , to welcome home the hostages held by students in the Islamic Republic of Iran .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"He was very proud of the name Ahmed Merabet, proud to represent the police and of defending the values of the republic - liberty, equality, fraternity.""  As the new edition of Charlie Hebdo hits the stands with another cartoon cover depicting a weeping Prophet Muhammad under the heading ""All is forgiven"" , a critical question must be asked .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whom are we poking fun at? The terrorists or Muslims in general?  How can we use the prophet as the signpost to make fun of the terrorists while Lassana Bathily, a young Muslim immigrant from Mali, saved a whole group in the kosher supermarket and provided police with the key to ending the hostage crisis at the store .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Could it be that his inspiration and values are informed by the example of the prophet ; did we ask how he feels about the new cartoon and do we care to listen to the answer?  Who is being forgiven - the prophet, the terrorists or Muslims who believe in Islam and rightly hold the prophet in high esteem? By framing the response with the prophet cartoon , Charlie Hebdo is echoing CEO Rupert Murdoch's tweet that all Muslims ""must be held responsible"" for the Paris attack .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Francois Hollande in a ceremony honouring the three fallen police officers appropriately expressed the sentiments of many stating , ""France is at war against terrorism, jihadism, radicalism . France is not at war against Islam and Muslims"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  Charlie Hebdo's new cover will complicate matters further and in a short period will sideline many Muslims at a critical time in this global struggle against terrorism .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Charlie Hebdo and the press have the right to publish what they like but Muslims are free to be offended by what is published and it is their right to be critical of such depictions .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No one should tell Muslims what they should or shouldn't get offended by as it is up to them to determine it for their community .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By depicting the prophet in a cartoon drawing , Charlie Hebdo chose racism and Islamophobic discourse against all Muslims .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This action transformed the discussion from one focused on terrorism, jihadism and murder into a narrow theological and legal debate concerning what can and can't be represented in images about the prophet .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is an issue involving all Muslims not only the terrorists .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another wasted opportunity to build on unity and bring Muslims into the global fold but Charlie Hebdo's editors chose to stay in the mud of racism and Islamophobia .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some argued that they had no choice and they needed to stay true to who they are by printing such a cartoon ; however this would be even more the case that the terrorist forced the subject of the cover rather than the other way around .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Freedom of the press proponents will celebrate the release of the new cover and view it as a triumph over terrorism by insulting all Muslims through another racist cartoon depicting the prophet , as a hooked-nose Arab looking man .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let's be clear that the overwhelming majority of Muslims will continue to uphold their tradition that it is impermissible to represent the prophet's likeness in the form of an image , while certainly few had the opinion in the past that it is not prohibited .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This will not change anytime soon and it is none of anyone's business other than Muslims to decide on this matter .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Charlie Hebdo's cartoon attempted to bring the prophet into the debate around terrorism and Muslim violence , which in my view is a shortsighted strategy to deal with a most serious problem .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By selecting the prophet as the site of contestation , Charlie Hebdo took a page from the clash of civilisation advocates and built a cartoon narrative around it .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In doing so they joined the coalition with the global Islamophobic industry and neo-conservative network that have been pushing this framing for almost 30 years and for sure since the collapse of the Soviet Union .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are in agreement that the terrorists claimed to act on behalf of Islam and as Malek Merabet stated his brother likewise is a Muslim and defended the newspaper from an ethical and moral ground that I fully believe are informed and grounded in Islam .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In deciding to print the new cover poking fun of the prophet's image , Charlie Hebdo sided with the terrorist framing of Islam and not with the Muslim police officer who lost his life defending them and would have been likewise offended by the new publication .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I do believe that if Ahmad Merabet were alive today he would still show up at the newspaper to protect the individuals and their freedom to insult his faith while deeply aggrieved by it .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One can have the freedom to say and do something while understanding the pain that it causes others if it is actually carried out .,common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today would have been a great day to have a cartoon of Ahmed smiling at the terrorist while defending the newspaper and the cartoonists in the name of his Islam .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not giving into the terrorist but standing with Muslims in opposing terrorism and by affirming the pain and suffering they experienced as a result of the heinous crime committed in their name .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet on a deeper level, the terrorist purporting to speak for Islam is a crime in itself , which for many Muslims would be akin to accepting the KKK claims to be the authentic voice of Christianity .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By framing the response to the terrorist through an explicit link to Islam , we are granting them the credentials they want and directing more attention to their cause .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The proper response should have been to remove their Islamic claims and celebrate and embrace the real Muslim heroes who defended and protected lives at both the Charlie Hebdo offices and the shoppers at the kosher supermarket .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who are we poking fun at? The Muslims as diverse minorities in France living at the margins of society are the object of the satire ; not the powerful or the terrorists .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The fact that there have been only two countries in Latin America accepting Guantanamo inmates is already particularly extraordinary, given US historical ascendancy on the region .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even US' main allies in the region, Chile and Colombia, rejected US proposals to accept prisoners from Guantanamo , considering the move highly unpopular .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is only in the second part of his open letter that his political goals become apparent .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mujica asks, as a gesture of reconciliation for all the American people, for the release of a 70 years-old Puerto Rican independence fighter, along with three Cuban detainees who are part of the group known as the Cuban Five , and whose controversial detention in the late 1990s led to a worldwide campaign for their release .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He also asks for the lifting of the ""unjust embargo"" imposed on ""our sister"" Cuba .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mujica's plea is reflective of an emerging regional bloc different than the usual ""left-leaning"" one .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is instead a heterogeneous regional political bloc able to come to terms with ideological differences and to find common ground for regional coexistence in the name of progress .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Mujica's move, therefore, is not unprecedented .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Back in 2009 the late Hugo Chavez hinted at the possibility of accepting Guantanamo detainees in Venezuela and at raising the issue of Cuba's isoluation .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cuba's reintegration into regional life, after decades of US ostracism, represents the main political goal of the bloc and of Mujica humanitarian operation .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"As Marta Sanchez and others who experienced the assault remembered , the people of El Chorrillo , whose descendants came from the Caribbean to Panama as cheap labour to build the canal , never knew what hit them when they awoke to the sounds of machine gun fire from the 82nd Airborne division .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When the firing stopped and the smoke from the fires finally subsided , thousands were dead and the neighbourhood largely destroyed .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Black Lives Matter"" is a refrain whose importance is reflective of the value that black people place on our lives , yet we must disabuse ourselves of the illusion that black lives or any other lives matter when they stand in the way of the political and capital interests of US elites and that it is not limited to black communities in the US .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As human rights strategist Ajamu Baraka points out : ""The black lives taken by the murderous assault on Panama 25 years ago should be a sober reminder that US state violence is not confined to ghettoes and barrios of the US but is a central component of the racist, colonial, capitalist project that is the US . We cannot pretend that police brutality in the US and the devaluation of black life that it represents is restricted just to the black experience in the heart of the US empire.""  The attack on Panama and the massive loss of life and destruction was a harbinger of the lawlessness and aggression that would characterise US policies in the unipolar world of the late 20th and early 21st century .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When President Noriega failed to support US efforts to destabilise Nicaragua and had the audacity to publicly defy the US state with his defiant rhetoric , Bush had a perfect opportunity to establish the terms for what he referred to as a new world order of unchecked US power .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Panama became a demonstration project to communicate to the nations of the global south that resistance to US hegemony would be met with ferocious violence .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fact that scores of black lives would be lost as part of the demonstration was of no consequence to the policymakers of hegemony .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The structures and relations of repression are linked from the centre of the empire to its periphery states .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"US police forces train police departments throughout the world through programmes such as the International Taskforce Agent Training, (conducted by US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations) including police officers that work in communities like El Chorrillo .",common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US police forces bring with them their military, interrogation, intimidation and racially biased tactics which involve use of excessive force on civilians .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is also internationally known that police are quicker to use force, shoot and kill black people, the same way that the US is quick to invade smaller countries with less power , because in the scope of the political reality, they matter less .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Violence is integral to the project of western colonial capitalist domination from Palestine to Ferguson .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""On this 25th anniversary of the US invasion of Panama, we need to remember that the struggle for black liberation is ongoing . US authorities must be made to understand that the value of black life is not determined by the borders that those black bodies find themselves .

The announcement of a new era of relations between the United States and Cuba came as a surprise to many who follow and study the relationship between the two rivals .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The old guard of Cuban exiles, led by Senator Marco Rubio, predictably reacted with their usual anger .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By contrast, many second generation Cuban Americans and advocates reacted differently - with optimism and hope for change .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is important to understand those reactions to the recent announcement as part of a broader evolution towards new relations between the US and Cuba over 20 years in the making, following fundamental security, economic, and political changes .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The end of the Cold War in 1989 spelled change for Latin America , just as it did for the world .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Cuba, it meant the loss of its biggest sponsor , which plunged the island into a five-year economic tailspin, contracted its GDP by 30 to 45 percent, and precipitated a number of changes to Cuban policy and law .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Those reforms have accelerated throughout the last decade, including an ongoing plan to unify the island's dual currency .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cuba has had no choice but to liberalise portions of its economy and European countries have been able to take advantage of those opportunities .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the last two decades, a Cuban economy starved for growth has looked overseas and seen the island more willing to come to agreement regarding foreign presence .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The implications of the fall of the Soviet Union were not only economic in nature, but also resulted in a shift in US policy towards Latin America more broadly .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the 20-plus years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the US has tolerated, or even openly collaborated with , leftist regimes in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Honduras that in another era would have been deliberately undermined, or perhaps overthrown, as in the cases of Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The strategic and military calculus of our relationship with Cuba has fundamentally changed .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Presidents and Congress no longer have the blanket justification of Cuba as a military threat as they did during the Cold War .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Cuban exiles, 1989 was not so much a watershed moment as an opportunity to continue applying pressure to a failing regime .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Cuban-American lobby continued to promote isolationism , believing that this post-Soviet moment was finally the chance to see a democratic counterrevolution on the island .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This belief that isolation would force the collapse of Castro regime restricted policy responses available to the US government and presidential administrations .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Changes in the global economic and political relationship with Cuba did not affect US policy and Cuba, for the most part, was excluded from the more moderate and tolerant US foreign policy towards Latin America .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Republican presidents and legislators proved to be more punitive towards the island - particularly given their reliance on the Cuban-American lobby for monetary and electoral support in south Florida .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite a cooling in relations during the late 1990s, due to the shooting down of the two US planes flown by ""Brothers to the Rescue"", President Bill Clinton eased restrictions on humanitarian aid, broadened the ability to send remittances , increased allowable person-to-person interactions, and resumed direct flights between the countries .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Clinton's actions were part of a broader government strategy of ""constructive engagement"" , in which the US would actively engage with the Cuban people, but maintain pressure on the government .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The new millennium did not bring significant changes in relations as, true to Republican form , President George W Bush maintained the status quo of ""constructive engagement"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If anything , his administration took a harder line, at times including Cuba in the same paragraph as the ""Axis of Evil"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However , even as President Bush, Senator Marco Rubio, and conservative Cuban- American legislators continued to push a hard line on Cuba , the profile of the average Cuban American changed .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The stereotypical conservative Cuban - still upset, and rightfully so, over the nationalisation of private property and human rights abuses during the revolution - still attempts to dominate political discourse .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But a new face of the Cuban American has emerged - young, second-generation children have come of age with the desire to see for themselves the homeland that they have only heard about in stories ; and new, post-1989 migrants , who are economic rather than political refugees , have closer personal ties to the island .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The election of President Obama and the nomination of Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State signalled a new era with a renewed focus on diplomacy .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Four months after taking office , the administration quietly continued to liberalise relations between the US and Cuba .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  Alan Gross' imprisonment in 2009 gave opportunity for the age-old arguments against Cuba to resurface , with the old guard claiming that nothing had changed and seeing it as the latest example of the long history of Cuban aggression .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I do not dispute the fact that the Castro brothers have been harsh dictators and that their system of government has deeply damaged multiple generations of Cubans, nor do I dispute that regime change should still be a goal of US policy .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However as my analysis has shown , the rest of the story has changed .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cuba's economy continues to search for growth , and the government is actively looking outside the country for investment .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Long gone are the existential security threats that came from the island during the Cold War .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moreover ,  this reflects the changing opinions of Cuban Americans .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The new modes of engagement announced by Obama on December 17 were not an acknowledgement of defeat , but an effort for a new way forward that reflects those changes .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"December 17 will no doubt be an important moment in the lives of Cubans and Cuban Americans , but it deserves more analysis than the knee-jerk reactions on the front pages of newspapers and talk shows in the US .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Obama should be commended for basing policy on facts rather than emotions .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US must continue to actively engage with the island , lest we lose the opportunity to influence a neighbour that is gradually rejoining the regional and world economy and political order .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Days after the US military sent six cleared Guantanamo Bay detainees to Uruguay , these were some of the images published as part of a photo essay on December 14 in the Miami Herald .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The piece illustrated a vivid picture of human resilience after over a decade of extreme privation and suffering .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As inspirational as they were , the photographs also served as a stark contrast to the daily realities experienced by the former inmates during the course of their detention - realities still experienced by the 127 men still held there .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On Guantanamo's 13th anniversary, the US government must continue to work diligently without any more excuses to ensure due process for the remaining detainees and shut down one of the darkest holdovers from the ""war on terror"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Glimmer of hope .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a joint declaration issued last year by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, several other UN agencies and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the US was urged to ""adopt all legislative, administrative, judicial, and any other types of measures necessary to prosecute, with full respect for the right to due process, the individuals being held at Guantanamo Naval Base or , where applicable , to provide for their immediate release or transfer to a third country"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  of the total of 779 men and boys that have been detained at Guantanamo Bay since 2002 , only nine have been convicted of any crime .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of the 127 remaining detainees, 59 have been unanimously cleared by US intelligence and security agencies, of any involvement in terrorism but continue to await their release .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The remaining 68 inmates are classified as ""indefinite detainees"", a Kafka-esque category used for detainees ineligible for either trial or release .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These men will face Periodic Review Board hearings, an incipient interagency process that will assess whether an inmate poses a threat to the US or is eligible for transfer .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  this procedure lacks guarantees to due process and will likely prolong situations of arbitrary detention .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moreover , as inmate transfers continue , the US must abide by the principle of ""non-refoulement"" , ensuring detainees' right to not be returned to a place where they will face persecution, torture or death .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This guarantee was not upheld with cleared inmate and Centre for Justice and International Law and Centre for Constitutional Rights' client Djamel Ameziane , who was forcibly repatriated back to his birth country of Algeria despite stated fears of persecution and standing precautionary measures ordered in his favour .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Upon his return, Ameziane was detained by Algerian government agents as part of an ""evaluation process"" and subjected to abuses that left him in poor health .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ameziane's forcible repatriation is only one of several other cases .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2014 , two other men were involuntarily repatriated to Libya and , in 2007, two others were sent back to Tunisia .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Resettling detainees back to countries that will expose them and their families to threats, persecution, and - in the case of detainees who are not cleared - to ongoing detention and torture , will only deepen years of suffering and injustice .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US Senate committee's grisly report on the CIA's interrogation methods and the trickling repatriation of cleared inmates represent important steps towards making the truth of the ""war on terror"" available to the public .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  the question over how material and intellectual authors of torture will be held accountable in accordance with international law remains .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the US is not only forbidden from practising torture but required to prevent and hold accountable any individuals who are involved in these particular kinds of human rights violations .",common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Under this convention, US federal authorities are required to conduct ""prompt and impartial investigations"" of these crimes .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additionally ,  under the Common Article Three of the Geneva Convention - the article which bars torture, cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment against prisoners of war - the US could be held accountable for war crimes .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally , under international law, amnesty laws are not permitted and the authors of torture must be prosecuted - at home or abroad .",common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The public availability of documentation to establish the truth behind Guantanamo Bay will no doubt play a pivotal role in dismantling the architecture of state-sanctioned human rights abuses .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While the US Senate's scathing report revealed some of the most shocking instances of torture , its 6,700 pages are the tip of the iceberg .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In early December, a US judge ordered the disclosure of over 30 tapes depicting the controversial nasogastric force-feedings of hunger strikers in Guantanamo , including Abu Wael Dhiab - one of the six men released to Uruguay .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While attempts are being made by the Obama administration to overturn the ruling , human rights groups continue to demand for release of the tapes .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Almost six years after US President Barack Obama signed an executive order to shut down Guantanamo Bay , it is unfathomable that this international symbol for US human rights abuses remains open .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ongoing reluctance to punish those responsible for authorising and using torture is even more unfortunate .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  now more than ever, the US government can send a powerful message stating that no one is exempt from international accountability and prosecution .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What is done now will start to ensure that torture - or ""Enhanced Interrogation Techniques"" - are never used by the US or other military and intelligence personnel in situations of conflict .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"January 15 marks a decade since Mahmoud Abbas became the Palestinian president , during which time the goals he claims to espouse not only remain unrealised, but are more remote than ever .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He is still in office despite his term ending six years ago; the democratic process that brought him to power no longer in existence .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He speaks of his people's human rights while his Palestinian Authority actively curtails them .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He claims to champion their national rights while collaborating unconditionally with the country that denies them .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abbas' image as a hapless, harmless figure deflects from the cunning and ruthlessness of someone whose primary concern, like the Middle East's other autocrats , seems to be his longevity .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fact that he plays ball with the West and Israel somehow makes this okay .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Where other Arab strongmen nurture an image of power to maintain it , he relies on being seen as an underdog .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But this illusion , which has traditionally served Abbas well , no longer extends to his people .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many think he and the PA serve their own interests and those of Israel, rather than those of the Palestinians .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to a poll last month, 55 percent believe that the PA has become ""a burden on the Palestinian people"" .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Regarding the presidency, Abbas has consistently lagged in opinion polls behind his Fatah colleague, Marwan Barghouti .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since Israel's last Gaza invasion, he also runs behind Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Is it mere coincidence, then , that Abbas has been lacklustre in campaigning for Barghouti's release from Israeli jail; or in pursuing and implementing national unity deals with Hamas that call for elections?  Since the signing of the latest reconciliation agreement in April, Abbas has at various times threatened to end it , and has been openly adversarial towards Hamas .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Elections that were due within six months never happened , so he remains unchallenged - this has gone largely unnoticed .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The PA  - which is meant to safeguard Palestinian rights - serially abuses them .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Human Rights Watch has documented ""police beatings and arbitrary arrests of demonstrators"", ""excessive force"", ""repressing critical news reporting and demonstrations"", ""suppressing dissenting views"", and ""serious rights abuses, including credible allegations of torture"" , for which ""no security officials were convicted"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As such, the PA is not only failing to curb Israeli abuses , but is busy perpetrating its own, all under Abbas' watch .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The PA has garnered a reputation among Palestinians for managing the occupation rather than striving to end it .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One way it does this is ""security coordination"" with Israel , which Abbas described last year as ""sacred"" despite the vast majority of Palestinians opposing it .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Such coordination serves Israel by enabling it to subcontract its occupation , and serves the PA by helping it suppress internal dissent .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It certainly does not benefit the Palestinian people .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abbas and his foreign minister have made grotesque assurances that as long as he is president , he will not allow an uprising against Israel .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the PA , which is supposed to be part of a national liberation struggle , is willing to put down an uprising by its own people against their subjugation .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is nothing short of betrayal .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For more than 20 years, the PA has participated in a ""peace process"" that has greatly entrenched Israeli control .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abbas himself was an architect of the disastrous Oslo Accords .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The occupied territories are now so colonised and fragmented that a viable Palestinian state is widely considered impossible .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  Abbas still wants to negotiate , despite Israel being clearly opposed to Palestinian self-determination .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What , then ,  is the point of negotiating? Perhaps to preserve the privileged elites to which the PA and the ""peace process"" gave birth .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After all ,  allegations of corruption and nepotism, including Abbas and his family, are nothing new .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the help of international aid, the PA is the largest employer of Palestinians, much like other autocracies that encourage public dependence on the state to avoid mass unrest .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A power imbalance alone cannot explain Abbas' policy choices regarding Israel .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He opposes armed resistance, and has gone to great lengths to disarm militants in the West Bank .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  he also opposes peaceful forms of resistance, including the increasingly effective Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore ,  it took the PA more than two years since Palestine's upgraded UN status to apply to join the International Criminal Court , despite repeated threats to do so amid constant Israeli provocations .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That Abbas finally relented may not only, or necessarily, be about losing patience with Israel , but about assuaging mounting Palestinian anger at his procrastination in applying to the ICC .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile ,  he says he will keep pushing for a UN Security Council resolution calling for a deadline to end Israel's occupation , despite the certainty of repeated failure by US veto .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abbas seems to be attempting a balancing act .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He wants to prove to Israel, and his western and Arab backers , that he is their best Palestinian partner , safe in the knowledge that they will not accept Hamas rule , but mindful not to suffer the same fate as Yasser Arafat once he was no longer deemed useful or reliable .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  his recent, uncharacteristic defiance against Israel reflects a need to stop his flagging domestic popularity turning into an uprising against him and the PA .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had been holding Somers and Korkie captive for over a year .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was the second such attempt to rescue Somers in two weeks .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But something went terribly wrong in the final approach .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Perhaps it was a barking dog or some other noise , but the SEALs came under fire as they approached the compound's main entrance .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The element of surprise , which is so critical to rescue operations , was lost , and a fierce firefight ensued .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plainly necessary .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Late last week AQAP released a video stating he would be killed in 72 hours unless unspecified demands were met .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Those demands have not been made public, but likely involved payment of a ransom or release of AQAP captives, something the US is prohibited by law from doing .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Korkie, the sense of urgency in attempting the rescue operation is more controversial .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"By all odds , SYRIZA is leading the polls by 3 percent to 10 percent and is expected to form a government either based on a robust majority of the left in parliament, or, in coalition with minor parties who are willing to follow its agenda , renegotiate a bailout agreement that will not be catastrophic for Greek society and the Greek economy .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the fact that both the German and the Greek conservative governments present the current bailout programme as a ""success story"" , most analysts around the globe agree that it has actually failed .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This Samiti, a not-so-small wing of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a militant Hindu organisation, contended that far from propagating religious intolerance , it was only righting historical wrongs and injustice perpetrated by Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics who , in order to bolster the numbers of their respective faiths , had lured and coerced Hindus to stray from their original religion .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"One might well question - in face of such provisions , do the laws even need to use the modifiers ""forcible"" or ""fraudulent""?

The Islamic Republic's fleet of F-4s and F-14s were inherited from the Royal Iranian Air Force of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iran's advanced military allowed it to emerge as a regional hegemon .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since it shared a long border with the Soviet Union , the shah's armed forces served as a bulwark against Communist penetration in the Middle East and the oil-rich Gulf region, and a deterrent against an anti-western Baathist Iraq .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran's geostrategic location has not diminished as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No US or NATO ally, including Israel, Turkey or Saudi Arabia can cover Iran's geographical depth .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Video footage .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The video footage released by Al Jazeera of Iranian F-4s attacking ISIL forces in Iraq's Diyala province is reminiscent of another attack when two of the same US-supplied Iranian aircraft bombed Iraq's nuclear facility in Tuwaitha in 1980, during the first year of the Iran-Iraq War .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this first air strike, the US and the Islamic Republic shared the same interests, albeit for different purposes .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Islamic Republic feared Iraq could develop a nuclear option as it fought a two-front war for its survival, including a domestic Iranian Kurdish uprising , and a potential pro-shah counterrevolution launched from within the Iranian air force - the same unit that was needed to target Iraq .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US, despite its tensions with Iran during the hostage crisis, did not want to see Iraq develop a nuclear capability that could threaten its ally Israel during the 1980s .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Israel successfully followed up the attack against Iraq's nuclear facility in 1981 , and the US-led air strikes during the 1991 Gulf war were designed to destroy this nuclear infrastructure again , which had been rebuilt despite the Israeli air raid .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thus the air raid Iran conducted against ISIL was not the first time both Washington and the Islamic Republic might have both wished for a successful sortie of Iranian F-4 pilots .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Yet when Al Jazeera released the video of the air strike , the Iranian government initially denied the report , only to confirm it days later , adding the caveat that it was launched at the behest of the central government in Iraq .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The initial denial raises the question as to whether Iran did not want to upset this alliance of convenience with US by launching its own air strikes .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"However ,  even in that conflict, they do share a mutual desire for that conflict to end with a political solution .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Over the past week, US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Jawed Zarif have held long conversations in Geneva and Paris , lasting over seven hours .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both realise that more flexibility is required to avoid the break up of the talks .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"British Prime Minister David Cameron spoke on the subject with US President Barack Obama and the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the EU foreign policy chief all held talks separately with Zarif .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet if both sides continue to stick to their strict red lines it is questionable whether this round of talks will be any better than the last .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""Chances are less than 50/50,"" admits Obama, in a joint press conference with the British Prime Minister David Cameron when both leaders spent well over half of their press conferences spelling out what was at stake if a deal with Iran was not finalised by the June deadline .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Obama explained how ""the most successful, the most effective sanctions regime"" had eventually led Iran to the negotiating table .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He said : ""If we can get a verifiable deal with the necessary assurances then that would be the best deal.""  Yet Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson said sanctions are a ""worn out policy"" and asked the White House to adopt a ""logical approach"" .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran would not accept a deal that constrains its enrichment programme without the West reducing sanctions .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Now we have come to a stage in the talks that requires the other side to take its decision to enable us to move forward,"" said Zarif when arriving in Geneva .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""There needs to be some new and comprehensive proposals.""  The latest directive from Iran's leader , Ali Khamenei is that officials ""should take away the weapon of sanctions from the enemy"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Even one step in retreat will lead to enemy's advance,"" he said .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He is angered that ""Americans say flagrantly that even if Iran withdraws in the nuclear issue , the sanctions will not be lifted all together and at once"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Khamenei is referring to the main point of contention ; the issue of the period of curbing Iran's enrichment programme in exchange for the lifting of four sets of sanctions imposed on Iran by the UN, EU and the US .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The US wants the curbing of sanctions to be in a period covering well over 10 years, closer to 20 or in ""double digits"" as US administration officials put it .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is to ensure Iran's breakout time is prolonged .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran sees this as an attempt for forcing it to forego what it calls its peaceful enrichment programme .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It does not accept this long period of curbing its enrichment programme without the reciprocal reduction in sanctions .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is believed that the Iranian leader could be persuaded with anything below 10 years or a timeframe in a ""single digit"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Iran is deeply suspicious of the US and the West,"" said Obama .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mutual distrust is at the core of the failure of the unwillingness on both side to be flexible .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Khamenei still refers to the US as ""enemy"" and the US continues to refuse to lift sanctions fearing Iran's return to enrichment .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is not clear if western trust has taken another blow from reports that Syria is still trying to make nuclear weapons and has been getting help from Iran and North Korea .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The two sides would not be able to reach an agreement especially when the US Congress is pushing daily for imposing further sanctions in support of the Israeli lobby .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Republican Senator Mark Kirk and Democratic Senator Robert Menendez are finalising a bill for tougher sanctions .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Senator Bob Corker is also working on a bill to ensure the congress must approve any final deal with Iran .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran hardliners answer sanctions with the threat of enrichment .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Further sanctions will result in a vote in the Iranian parliament for continuing enrichment,"" said Ali Larijani, the head of Judiciary .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The enemies wanted to deprive Iran from its right to the nuclear technology and even resorted to military threats to this end.""  Hardline members of parliament are proposing a bill to increase the uranium enrichment programme to 60 percent .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""I am not , repeat, not suggesting that we are in immediate war footing , should negotiations with Iran fail,"" said Obama .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At the same time he made it clear he would veto any congressional attempts at new sanctions against Iran .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Hold your fire,"" he told the congress .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""We must not jeopardise the chance"" to get a verifiable deal with Iran .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although Republicans now hold a 54-46 seat majority in the Senate , it is not clear whether there would manage to get the 67 votes required in the Senate to override an Obama veto of any Iran legislation .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In intensive meetings with his European counterpart, Zarif has no doubt conveyed to them that if there is no easing of the sanctions there would be little he could do back home .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He has asked for ""serious and brave decisions"" in order to move forward .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The world has heard expressions of commitments and hope from Iran and the countries P5+1 for over a year now .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet those brave words must be coupled either with more flexibility as recommended by experts or coupled alternatively with new ideas, new methods and possibly new redlines .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is still time and several avenues are still open .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example there could be more direct involvement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, in the form of a representative, a high calibre UN negotiator , who could add momentum to the talks and create synergy .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Large, spontaneous vigils filled the streets of many French cities , while social media was awash with solidarity and condemnation, including the hashtags #JeSuisCharlie and #NotInMyName , which was used by Muslims condemning the attacks .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Police in France have identified and released the photographs of two brothers suspected to be involved in the attack while early speculation focused on the premise that Muslim extremists were behind the dreadful act, especially given the magazine's long history of satirising Islam and other religions .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The two brothers have been identified as 32-year-old Said Kouachi and 34-year-old Cherif Kouachi .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This theory has been reinforced by eyewitness accounts of the men shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The designer who was forced to let the assailants in says they told her they were with al-Qaeda , while , according to AFP, the police claim that one of the killers remarked : ""We have avenged the prophet.""  Why Prophet Muhammad would need anyone to ""avenge"" him is beyond me .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The prophet endured far more mockery, humiliation, insult and rejection during his lifetime without needing or ordering hitmen to defend his honour than that meted out by a group of equal-opportunity French cartoonists who despise and satirise all forms of organised religion .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even if ,  like with Anders Breivik in Norway , the perpetrators turn out not to be linked to Islamist groups , the collateral damage to French and European Muslims has already been done, despite one of the fallen police officers being a Muslim .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the strength of the Front National in France, UKIP in Britain and other anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant currents across Europe, a popular or populist backlash is almost inevitable .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"As someone who is well aware of the destructive influence of violent Islamism in the Middle East , I can, at a certain level, sympathise with fears in the West over radicalisation .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But Islamic extremism is mostly a threat to Muslim societies, not to Europe , as a minority has never, in history, imposed its will on a majority, except in the form of a military conqueror .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This exaggerated sense of threat can be seen in the enormous hysteria in segments of the media and among some politicians regarding the small trickle of European jihadists who have gone to fight in Syria .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although one gets the impression that Europe has sent forth a veritable Islamic army to the Levant , the real number is around 3,000 from across the continent, including the dead and returned, according to an estimate by Gilles de Kerchove, the EU's anti- terrorism chief .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While it is important to be vigilant and to find effective ways to deal with the threat posed by returning fighters , society must steer clear of stigmatising Europe's already marginalised and distrusted Muslim communities .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was born in July 1984 and I was only five months old when the disaster struck my community .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was too young to remember anything from the night of December 2, 1984 , but , throughout the years, I have heard many stories from the people who were there and saw it happen .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My sister would sometimes tell me things about that night , though we generally avoided bringing it up , as we knew that it would only hurt us to talk about it .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After the disaster, some of our relatives , who had heard about it on the radio , came and took us to Lucknow, around 600km from Bhopal .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We stayed with them for a few months , but they started treating us badly , as if we were a burden to them and their families , so it was our brother Sunil, another survivor from our family of 10 - aged 13 at the time of the disaster  - who decided to bring us back to Bhopal .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Subsequently, we were sent to an orphanage in Bhopal, called The SOS Children's Village .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sunil refused to live with us in the orphanage , and got involved with the anti-Carbide campaign .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Most of the members of this organisation were children from the community we were from - Jay Prakash Nagar (JP Nagar), right across the road from the main Bhopal plant .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"But ,  at the same time, I did not know anything about our parents .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In middle school, we would have parent-teacher meetings at school ; my classmates had their parents next to them for the meeting , but I had no one next to me .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was around that time that I started asking my sister about our parents .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was then that my sister first told me about the Bhopal gas disaster and what had happened that night .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Until then, I never fully understood that I was growing up in an orphanage and didn't really know the meaning of the word ""orphanage"" .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's not as if we weren't warned about the CIA .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some 50 years before the Senate Intelligence Committee issued its 500-page report on torture , former President Harry Truman published an opinion piece in the Washington Post asserting that the CIA was out of control and calling for it to be broken up .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Truman's column appeared on December 22, 1963, a month to the day following US President John F Kennedy's assassination and 11 years after he himself moved out of the White House .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Truman argued, as the president who authorised its establishment in 1947 , that the CIA had strayed from the mission he had intended for it .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He had favoured creation of the CIA so that a president would have one agency providing him with objective foreign intelligence, rather than having to rely upon the often conflicting information being served up by the Departments of State, Defense, and others who ""slanted to conform to established positions of a given department"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Viewing intelligence gathering as its sole mission , Truman was disturbed ""by the way the CIA has been diverted from its original assignment .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the government."" He said he had ""never had any thought"" that the CIA would involve itself in ""cloak and dagger operations"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But it had which ""has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is clearly of some significance that Truman published his piece just one month after Kennedy's assassination .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although there is no evidence that Truman was suggesting CIA involvement in the assassination , it is impossible to believe that the late president's difficulties with the CIA were far from Truman's mind .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a former president who the Kennedy White House regularly briefed on foreign policy issues and decisions , Truman knew how the CIA essentially steamrolled Kennedy into the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba (and other anti- Castro actions) , leading Kennedy to tell a friend that he wanted ""to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kennedy never had the chance to follow up on that idea but it was essentially what Truman suggested a month after Kennedy's death .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Obviously, Truman's recommendation had no effect .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  the Washington establishment apparently took action to see that Truman's piece disappeared almost without a trace (easier in those pre-internet days) .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, the Washington Post only published the piece in its morning edition , pulling it from view after that (a peculiar way to treat an opinion piece by a former president, especially on such a weighty issue) .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"McGovern also reports that former CIA Director Allen Dulles , who Kennedy fired after the Bay of Pigs debacle , actually flew down to Truman's home in Independence, Missouri to get the former president to retract .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although Dulles reported back to his friends that Truman had indeed recanted , he clearly never did .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  six months after publishing the column in the Post , Truman wrote to the managing editor of Look Magazine that he intended the CIA as an intelligence gathering agency only and not a place where ""strange activities"" would be launched .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No doubt, the Bay of Pigs and Cuba, in general, were not the only examples of CIA interventions that disturbed Truman .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the years between the end of Truman's administration and his Washington Post column, the CIA had orchestrated the overthrow of governments in Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), Congo (1960), Dominican Republic (1961), South Vietnam (1963), Brazil (1964) .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Within a year following Truman's death, the CIA successfully brought down the Allende government in Chile (1973) .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"According to historian William Blum , writing in Foreign Policy Journal , in the last 69 years, the CIA has (often in conjunction with the military) ""(1) attempted to overthrow more than 50 governments , most of which were democratically-elected, (2) attempted to suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20 countries, (3) grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries, (4) dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries, (5) attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders.""  And now there are the horrific reports of torture and, equally appalling, the defense of CIA torture by former CIA driectors, other top CIA officials and, most enthusiastically, former Vice President Dick Cheney who famously told NBC five days after 9/11 that it was now time for US intelligence agencies to operate on the ""dark side"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"One is the Popular Mobilisation forces , which seem to field approximately 100,000 troops, including a well-trained offensive cadre of around 20,000 fighters .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The final potential force is the National Guard that is being considered as an option by Iraqi politicians .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Iraqi army can draw on some illustrious history .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Iraq's five lightning offensives in April, May and June of 1988 shattered the Iranian army and were textbook examples of planning and execution .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If the Iraqi army can be rebuilt with Shia, Sunni Arab and Kurdish political support , and if the well-led Ministry of Defense can guide the National Guard initiative , the coming year could witness new Iraqi army victories at Mosul .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Just nine months before Peshawar, on March 3, 2014 two suicide bombers unleashed their mayhem inside the District Court complex in Islamabad .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Once inside, they lobbed grenades and fired bullets , people scrambled everywhere, papers flew and bodies fell .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As happens in the aftermath of every one of the hundreds of bombings that have taken place in Pakistan this year , the attack on the District Court in Islamabad was claimed by one of the terror groups operating in Pakistan .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like the Army Public School attack that would come months later , the aftermath of carnage was grotesque, the bits and pieces of the instruments of justice, papers of pleadings, the black jackets worn by lawyers, spread all over what had become a crime scene .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Attacks on courts are not the only problem in the adjudication of terrorism cases .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terror suspects, in the cases where they are even apprehended , are rarely tried let alone convicted .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the war on terror has trundled on , Pakistan's Court system has lacked the security or the power to conduct terrorism trials and produce convictions .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In numbers obtained from 2012, it was found that the conviction rate for terrorism cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province , where many attacks were concentrated , was a paltry 4 percent .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Punjab, the situation was not much better .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In 2012 the Special Anti-Terrorism Court in that province heard 559 cases against terror suspects and 414 of these ended with acquittals .,statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to Khurram Khan, a Deputy Special Prosecutor, ""Witnesses have a high rate of recanting because of fear or threats in kidnapping for ransom cases  [...] Very few people come forward . Since we don't have a witness protection program , they change their statements.""  In more high profile cases, the witnesses face death threats .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Between 1990 and 2009, a time when Pakistan suffered thousands of terrorist attacks and suicide bombings, the acquittal rate in terror cases was 74 percent .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The establishment of military courts for a period of two years is supposed to be a solution to all of this .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If the military that is bombing terrorist hideouts in the north of the country is also given the task of adjudicating the cases , the new logic goes , terrorists will certainly be punished and tragedies like Peshawar will never happen again .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is a false premise .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  it is not the first time that military courts have been established in Pakistan , subverting and sidelining the country's already ailing civilian courts .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On October 17, 1979 not long after General Zia ul Haq took over the country in a military coup , military courts were established (along with a ban on political activity and a muzzling of the Press) .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The decisions of these closed courts could not be challenged in any civilian courts and once that court was established , any matter could be transferred to its jurisdiction .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result, over one hundred such courts were established .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The powers they gave to the military allowed large-scale arrests and detentions of political workers and journalists .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hundreds of people were flogged and imprisoned simply for participating in normal political activity that was banned under martial law .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the present case, martial law has not been declared in Pakistan ; however ,  turning over the adjudication of terror cases undoubtedly undermines the country's civilian judiciary .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  the secrecy surrounding military courts leaves them open to charges of contravening legal principles and pursuing their own vendettas against this or that terrorist group instead of sticking to the principles of justice and obtaining convictions via fair procedures .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given that military courts in Pakistan do not work under a system of legal precedent , little information exists as to the basis of convictions and acquittals .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moreover , since evidence is rarely made public , plenty of room is created for conspiracy theorists to place doubt on any conviction that is produced under their auspices .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A confused Pakistani public , whose anti-imperialist fervour often leads it to championing extremist outfits against what it perceives as US meddling , desperately needs to see the evidence against terror suspects .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is only when the procedures for doing so are clear and transparent that the hearts and minds vulnerable to conspiracy theories that blame foreign hands will be forced to confront extremism as a home grown issue .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The aftermath of every terror attack sees a burgeoning of just this sort of denial, whetted and promoted by groups themselves ; the consequent moral murkiness makes it impossible for a Pakistani public to see terrorism as a black and white issue .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is only where the evidence against the evil masterminds of blasts and bombings is openly available and fairly presented will it be impossible to ignore .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second , the low conviction rate in civilian courts is a problem ; but it is one that can and should have been solved by providing protection to adjudicators, witnesses and other parties instead of rendering civilian courts altogether irrelevant .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Pakistani army undoubtedly possesses the capability to do this and does it regularly for its own leaders .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similarly civilian security outfits regularly protect police officials, Parliamentarians and other office holders , all of whom roam the country with heavy security cordons that are not available to lawyers, judges and witnesses in terror cases .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally ,  the establishment of military courts resurrects the old military- civilian schism from the dregs of Pakistani history and leaves the issue of extremism languishing in the middle .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The memory of the old military courts and their excesses against pro democracy agitators and writers who opposed martial law may be distant but is not forgotten .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The scepticism of the military and its machinations refreshed by this latest announcement is something that will only weaken what should be in Pakistan a united front against extremism .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The old narrative of pro-democracy activists harassed by military courts can easily be hijacked by today's extremists , who can present themselves as similarly beleaguered and innocent , their convictions illegitimate because they were handed down by military courts .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the shoulders of such familiar manipulations, they will not be condemned convicts but heroes .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terror is a people's problem in Pakistan, with nearly a thousand deaths in over 372 attacks just this year .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The extremists who are wreaking this havoc must be accountable to the people, via judicial institutions that serve the public .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The evidence has to be seen by all and the rules made plain and clear .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The consequence then would be an unequivocal condemnation untainted by conspiracy and paranoia and constructed on fairness .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ultimately , winning the war against extremists requires mobilising Pakistan's public against terror ; military courts cannot achieve this crucial goal .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The last few days in global finance have been marked by dramatic developments in the energy sector .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oil prices have collapsed by about 40 percent since this year's peak in June .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The plummeting oil prices have had negative consequences on economies across the world, from Moscow to Caracas to Tehran .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The situation is particularly bad in Russia where the shock of shrinking energy revenue is doubled by a monetary crisis .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just in the past week the Russian rouble lost 17 percent of its value in two days ; its exchange rate to the US dollar has collapsed by over 50 percent since the beginning of the year .,statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Balancing an oil-dependent budget .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The energy crisis has its origin in a global surplus of crude oil supply resulting from a rapid expansion of oil production in the US .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to dissuade additional investments in production of shale oil and tar sands in North America, and wedge a war on market shares , Saudi Arabia has voluntarily gone far above its previous OPEC production commitment .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some have seen this move as a plot by the Americans to punish countries like Iran and Russia .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  the sharp decrease in oil prices to $60 per barrel is far below the breakeven point for countries such as Venezuela and Iran who need $140 per barrel to balance their budget and continue with their policies of social spending and subsidised imports of vital goods .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Russian economy is also very vulnerable to such price fluctuations as the energy sector accounts for about half of the state's revenues and a quarter of its gross domestic product .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Putin's gamble to assume that the West would not confront him over Ukraine because of energy security concerns was a miscalculation of the forces at play .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The shrinking oil revenues coupled with the economic sanction packages have destroyed investors' confidence in the Russian economy , resulting in record levels of capital flight and a plunging rouble .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to the Russian ministry of economic development , food prices in Russia will increase by 12 percent by the end of this year , and conservative estimates for the first months of 2015 already set inflation at 10 percent .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The recent announcement that Moscow was considering developing its own independent space station is just another smoke screen to hypnotise the Russian population .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

December 9 marks the six-month anniversary of ISIL's capture of Mosul .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The capture both put ISIL on the map and simultaneously threatened to fundamentally redraw it .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Coverage of the low level civil war in Iraq had long disappeared off the front pages with a war weary western public happy to be ""out"" of a complex conflict that seemed to have no end .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The boldness of ISIL's sweep through the region and the taking of Mosul was the trigger that sparked a new focus on Iraq and put US warplanes back in the sky , but the city itself was quickly forgotten .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today, Mosul is a city on death row enduring both a terrible present and the potential of a worse future .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Initial ideas of a swift retaking of the city were dispelled by the ousting of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and the emergence of US President Barack Obama's anti-ISIL coalition .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ISIL has proved to be a resilient opponent and while its march forward has been held up in Kobane , Mosul remains under the black flag .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In November, Deputy Governor of Mosul Nuraddin Kaplan said that ""the sooner the operation begins the better . The more time that passes , the harder it will become"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Moves to retake Mosul are in the pipeline but I would argue that the priority should be given to the strategy of prompting a collapse from within as opposed to a destructive attempt to take it by force .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ISIL's predecessors, ""al-Qaeda in Iraq"", struggled to turn from capturing large urban areas to governing them and reports out of Mosul would suggest a similar trend is at play .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What information there is that manages to come out paints a bleak picture under ISIL rule .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In October, the Guardian reported ""severe shortages of food and water, no functioning public institutions, and the local economy in a state of near collapse"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The school system has been ""ISIL-ed"" with an education tax imposed , genders segregated and subjects such as art banned .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Christian homes and Shia shrines have reportedly been looted and displaced residents of Mosul testified to Al - Monitor that ISIL had arrested up to 25,000 people between June and October .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We've also learnt the ISIL-style of city governance elsewhere and in particular in Raqqa, their nominal capital .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An incredibly brave piece of citizen journalism shot by a resident in a hijab showed a city dominated by young, bearded men with guns on every street corner imposing both their ideas of urban management and social control .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prayer and conservative appearance is strictly enforced and executions, even crucifixions, are commonplace .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a bitter irony that residents of Raqqa have swapped one police state for another .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A smart strategy would seek to win Mosul from within .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ISIL's ability to attract disillusioned Iraqi Sunnis is being met by new Prime Minister Haider al-Abbadi's far more inclusive vision for the country .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Appointing a defence minister from Mosul and finally agreeing on an oil sharing agreement with the Kurds is evidence of this work in progress from the new premier .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abbadi's appeal to Iraqi nationalism and sensitivity to tribal and sectarian dynamics must be able to offer a bigger pull than the ISIL offer of a dysfunctional caliphate .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Residents of ISIL-controlled Raqqa have spoken of feeling like ""strangers in their own city"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Effective propaganda can help split Iraqi members of ISIL from their often foreign leadership .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This won't be easy , reports have suggested that ISIL has decided to shut down most mobile telecommunications inside the city, perhaps conscious of the need to protect their battle for hearts and minds .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The alternative is far more dangerous for the city .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
US intelligence estimates that ISIL has the weapons to fight for two years .,testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A rejuvenated Iraqi army that has put competency, sectarian and ""ghost soldiers"" issues aside is estimated to need some 80,000 troops to ""take"" the city .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Supposedly accurate US weapons destroyed a large part of Fallujah in order to ""win it"" back in 2004 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With this in mind ,  there is a high chance Mosul would be hit even harder leaving a trail of rubble and refugees strewn across the north of the country .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The fate of Syria's second city, Aleppo, must serve as a warning as to the future of Iraq's second city, Mosul .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An effective and joined up political and military strategy led by Iraq's new government must make the residents of Mosul hate the caliphate and, at tremendous risk to themselves, take on ISIL from within rather than allow their city to become yet another Middle East urban graveyard .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mosul is a city of immense history but currently stares at the fate of becoming history itself .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The headscarf ban in 2004, followed by illegalisation of the niqab, or face covering, in 2010, codified core Islamophobic ideas .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This legislation also functioned as a firm and fervent declaration by the state that Muslim and French identities were at odds and irreconcilable .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The French laicite model provided the structural underpinnings to carry forward Islamophobic legislation .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But more nefariously, guise it under the banner of state-sponsored secularism .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Expectedly, the religious expression bans disparately impacted French Muslims .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition ,  they chilled bodily and verbal expressions of Muslim identity .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The state aim of compelling secularisation upon its Muslim citizenry was based upon the civilisational binary, and ultimatum , to choose between ""Islam and the West"", ""Muslim lands or France"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite this ultimatum handed down from the state, the overwhelming majority of French Muslims exercised their faith amid pervasive bigotry .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Collateral indictment of French Muslims, by politicians and media alike, infused with an already fervent culture of Islamophobia on the ground, will surely incite violent backlash against Muslims and Muslim communities in the country .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although unimaginable before Wednesday , French Islamophobia stands to become far more severe and strident .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The conflation of the terrorist's acts with France's Muslim population, from the perspective of hatemongers, holds the latter vicariously liable .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This connection , that links three deviant actors with an entire faith and millions of disconnected citizens , will fuel rabid backlash against Muslims in France, and more than likely, claim additional victims .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Centring Muslim victims, instead of villains, would mitigate the backlash considerably .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition , focusing on the heroics of Merabat, instead of the evil of the three terrorists , asserts - and inserts - a competing narrative that France's Muslims are everyday citizens : Citizens with jobs, families, and interpretations of Islam that condemn violence, and contradict the malignant caricature of the faith constructed by the state .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ahmed Merabat was more than a victim .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was far more than merely a Muslim .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He, in both life and especially in death, stands as an archetype for the overwhelming majority of French Muslims .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A law-abiding citizen, Merabat harmonised his religious identity with the responsibilities of being a Frenchman .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tactical nukes are particularly problematic because their short range provides the missing link between a localised conventional war and a highly improbable global exchange of strategic nuclear missiles between Moscow and Washington .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tactical nuclear weapons are no status quo weapons .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Their battlefield purpose increases the chance of a nuclear escalation , which is why the superpowers removed most of them from Central Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If everything goes to plan , the controversial B61 weapons will be modernised by around 2020 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This ""life extension programme"" is not simply an initiative to replace rusty old nukes with shiny new ones , but an attempt to increase their accuracy , to replace free fall with precision guided bombs .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ultimately, this will transform the B61 into a new kind of weapon and undermine any pretence that the West is still in the game of denuclearisation .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One topic he has precious little to say about is the alliance's nuclear policy .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When I prompt him , Shea explains that while the life extension programme was originally meant to provide NATO with a bargaining chip for future nuclear disarmament talks with the Kremlin , Russia's involvement in Eastern Ukraine fundamentally altered the strategic context , rendering the B61 ""once again a part of NATO's deterrence posture"" .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"These anti-Jonathan lawmakers have told whoever cared to listen that they would table the president's sins on December 16, 2014 when they reconvene from their current recess .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chief among the president's reported sins are failure to contain the raging insurgency in the north ; refusal to sign some bills ; and alleged unauthorised expenditure of 1.7 trillion Naira (about $9.5bn) on the oil subsidy fund in 2011 .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"But then , why are the senators just waking up to the existential realities in Nigeria? Why are they just discovering that the president spent more than what was approved for the oil subsidy fund in 2011?  The point is , the lawmakers desperately need financial and political support to pursue their campaigns for the general elections coming up in February 2015 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And the best way to get this , I suspect , is to blackmail the president with impeachment or removal .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is not to say that there are no foreign policy implications of this debacle .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sony's decision to make a comedy about the assassination of the North Korean head of state was a terrible idea that has only worsened the US' already terrible relations with this very unstable nuclear-armed nation .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This draft was no different .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  insufficient support among Council members was the initial reason given months ago by the PA for a delay in the vote .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As such, it must have known prior to presenting the draft that it would fail , so why go through with it?  In fact ,  why did the PA try to push through a resolution in the first place? Even if it mustered the minimum votes , the US would have used its veto , and the PA knew it .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not only have the Americans consistently scuppered any resolution that places even the slightest criticism or pressure on Israel , but Washington had been explicit about its intention to use its veto this time round if necessary .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What would be the point in the face of an assured American veto?  The only way Washington would acquiesce was if the resolution called for an end to the Palestinian occupation of Israel .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This makes PA President Mahmoud Abbas's recent statement that he had repeatedly postponed the resolution due to US pressure equally puzzling .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Did he actually think anything he could say or do would lead to the US dropping such pressure , or that it would accept the draft that was presented?  In any case, months of consultations and various reasons for delays only resulted in the continued watering down of the text .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Indeed ,  the draft did not contain any wording that would cause Israel to worry .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given that the US veto shields Israel , and that existing resolutions are ignored with impunity , it is astounding that the PA had any faith left in the Council to attempt its latest futile exercise at statehood .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even the response of its UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour was telling in this regard ; ""The Security Council has once again failed to uphold its charter duties to address this crises and to meaningfully contribute to a lasting solution in accordance with its own resolutions.""

"The US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, had the gall to say the resolution undermined efforts to ""achieve two states for two people"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most commentators place an emphasis on the possible role external factors have played in this act of terrorism .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Various external factors are cited , but they mostly focus on the conflicts in the Middle East and international tensions in general, in a bid to link the Paris attacks to extremist ideologies that promote such murderous acts .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A week after the attack, the French political class and key media outlets remain focused on the security aspect and barely attempt to address the issue from a different angle .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They do not question the responsibility held by French society and state - as well as the role of the socioeconomic policies practised by successive French governments - in addressing the woes of the socially marginalised and disenfranchised zones from which the Kouachi brothers sprang .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How can this act be attributed only to dogmatic ideological motivations and grievances over international conflicts, given that the religious and ideological indoctrination process is too complicated to be attributed solely to external factors?  As both French officials and analysts respond with emotion , they ignore a series of socioeconomic factors that have fuelled the motivations of the actors .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is important to remember that the perpetrators of the attack were born and raised in France in a poor, disadvantaged area where unemployment rates among the youth aged 18 to 24 years reaches 45 percent (compared to the national rate which is nearly 10 percent) .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In these areas, called ""banlieues"" , state infrastructure is almost non - existent and the population is subject to segregation and racial discrimination in terms of access to employment opportunities and housing , which in most cases leads to exclusion from the civic sphere .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2006, an official case study focusing on access to employment conditions showed that 51 percent of young French candidates are subject to discrimination based on ethnic origin and/or skin colour .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These conditions result in social marginalisation and promote delinquency which in turn raises the chances of incarceration ; a place where religious indoctrination and ideological radicalisation mostly occur .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sociologist Robert Castel describes the situation of young people in these deprived areas as follows : ""These young people are not completely [living] outside of society , however ,  they are not inside it either , for they do not enjoy any recognised space/role  [...] Their situation is pretty paradoxical : they are citizens , who live on French territory , and yet they undergo differential and discriminatory treatment that disqualifies them . The republic, in contradiction with its own principles, seems incapable of integrating these young French people who live like the indigenous minority of the nation.""  This, combined with a conflicting social context that is constantly fuelled by debates over identity , religion and behavioural issues (such as the debate on national identity, the veil, halal food in schools, Islam and French secularism) further stigmatise this community and place it in a permanent state of confrontation with the rest of society .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This vicious cycle prevents any change in the dynamics of this relationship into a cooperative one that could help find solutions in order to improve their socioeconomical status .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention the mainstream media discourse permanently framing those zones and communities as an ailment to the society .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Young people are depicted in a caricaturist form, making it all the more difficult for them to socially and professionally integrate , which deepens their sense of marginalisation .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Such dynamics only complicate the relationship with the government, often seen as an opponent and sometimes as an enemy .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is the gap where religious indoctrination factors sneaks in - often occurring in prison environments where ethnic groups are predominantly from these areas and where 18- to 30 -year-olds represent 35 percent of the incarcerated population .,statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are these good enough reasons to explain the motives behind committing such a terrorist act? Of course not .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the conditions described above constitute the factors that facilitate and accelerate the ideological and religious indoctrination process .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Especially when protagonists have the financial resources (this is often the case) to attract the most fragile, the most helpless and the most excluded in order to step forward and enrol in extremist activities , the international context helps .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With such a grim reality, the question going forward would be if purely security measures are sufficient to challenge the terrorism that threatens France .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""France is at war against terrorism and against radical Islam,"" he said .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Exceptional measures will be taken to challenge terrorism.""  Valls mentioned exclusively security measures, such as reinforcing supervision within the prisons where Islamist prisoners are concentrated ; establishing inter-European border controls ; strengthening international intelligence cooperation ... however ,  there was no mention of a possible revision of the government's social policies to address the problems in the marginalised zones; no announcement of a reflection on a possible serious debate to propose a new approach to address all the socioeconomic ills affecting them .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The security measures announced by the prime minister are necessary, but not sufficient to contain terrorism ; the roots of extremism , where the first frustrations are formed , remain untouched .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is not to say that the French government should be solely held responsible for the situation which France is facing today .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nevertheless ,  failing to take into account the catastrophic socioeconomic factor would be tantamount to promoting the very context that contributes to the development of fundamentalist ideologies .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The privatisation process in Mexico has largely been conducted through dubious procedures orchestrated by corrupt federal governments .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"But the party's own poll campaign then underway accused Bangladeshi Muslims of ""destroying"" India .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So the killings jelled with the BJP's political rhetoric; just days before the May butchery , Modi declared that Bangladeshis must keep their ""bags packed"" for deportation if he captured power .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similarly , when NDFB slaughtered nearly a 100 Muslims and displaced half a million in July-August 2012 , senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani immediately extended moral support to the Bodos .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"It was a bizarre case of 20 percent ruling over 80 percent!  Because Bodos didn't enjoy numerical majority , they resorted to ethnic cleansing .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are many unanswered questions about the TTP .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How big is the group? Have its ties to the Pakistani intelligence agencies become stronger since Mullah Fazlullah, of Swat fame, became its leader, given his own past affiliation with Pakistan's powerful spy agency ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence)? Or is the group closer now to other foreign funders?  The absence of convincing answers to such questions has resulted in ongoing debates on the appropriate response to this horror .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From US-backed media personalities supporting the establishment of concentration camps for entire populations in some parts of the tribal areas, to the broadening of ongoing military operations , the overwhelming thrust among many vocal commentators has been for countering this violence with more violence .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  there is also a deep scepticism about a primarily military response within the Pakistani society , which is why successive governments have been secretive about such operations .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite repeated calls for stronger military action by the US government and also many influential commentators within Pakistan, there is widespread suspicion that these army operations end up killing more civilians than militants .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is easy, but completely misleading , to write off this widespread scepticism about military responses to the Taliban violence as driven by sympathetic sentiments or worse , as the inability of Pakistanis to face the hard facts of home-grown terror .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We must recognise that it is a mistrust borne of experience with the military's role in Pakistani politics .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More critically , we need to recognise the long-term impact of the Pakistani state's support for the ""war on terror"" and its operations in the tribal areas over the last decade .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is a growing sense of deprivation and discrimination among Pashtuns across the country , and further state violence in the region has to be carefully weighed against the very real possibility of serious backlash .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While we all agree that there must be a response to these atrocities , for it to be effective , both at the state and societal level , it is imperative that it is calibrated to the level of threat posed by wide range of groups contained within the category ""Taliban"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most secular generals of the Pakistani army have been happy to support some versions of Taliban as well as to benefit financially and politically by supporting the US war in the region .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"How did they get past the three check points in the defence colony where the school is located? Which cities/villages did the militants who were killed come from? How does that correspond to the profiles of the attackers in the past? Where is that information about past attackers anyway? What are their organisational careers and educational backgrounds? Where are their families , and what can they tell us about the path their sons took?  Calling on the very same generals to carry out military operations against the operatives they have supported and created is surely a strategy fraught with contradictions, though favoured by some vocal analysts and by the US government .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"However ,  the press after a brief period ignored the instructions and started using the word ""Crusade"" in discussing the occupation of Jerusalem .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The memo was intended to prevent any friction with Muslim troops recruited from British colonies to fight in the war and avoid harming the alliance with Sharif Hussein of Mecca .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More importantly, the British Department of Information itself began to use the word ""Crusade"" to convey a very distinctive religious and historical connection to earlier periods .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The department celebrated in a telegram from Palestine that ""two of the commanders who have played a great part in the South Palestine campaign are descended from knights who fought in the wars of the Crusades"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A few months after the conquest of Jerusalem, the Department of Information produced a 40-minute documentary entitled ""The New Crusades : With the British Forces on the Palestine Front"", thus articulating the new colonial adventure in distinctive religious terms .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore ,  a large number of books from the period had ""Crusade"" incorporated into their titles: ""Khaki Crusaders"" (1919), ""Temporary Crusaders"" (1919), ""The Modern Crusaders"" (1920), ""The Last Crusade"" (1920), ""With Allenby's Crusaders"" (1923), and ""The Romance of the Last Crusade"" (1923) .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There was a clear urge to frame the colonisation project in Palestine in religious terms and view it as a continuation of the earlier Muslim-Christian conflict, despite claims of fighting the Ottomans on the basis of European secularism and anti-religious modernity .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The British were not the only ones thinking in these terms .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In his book The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihads and Modernity , Tariq Ali describes how the French commander Henri Gouraud upon entering Damascus with his troops , went to Saladin's tomb, kicked it and proclaimed ; ""The Crusades have ended now! Awake Saladin, we have returned! My presence here consecrates the victory of the Cross over the Crescent"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The idea of the ""Crusade"" was incorporated into the support extended to the Zionist movement and the plan to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  theological interpretations and attempts at recreating the biblical past were aimed at ushering in a distorted extreme right-wing Christian vision of the world that involved Israel as a stepping stone for its realisation in anticipation of the Second Coming .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The British Occupation in 1917 made it possible to put into action the Balfour Declaration and the plan for building a Jewish homeland at the expense of the Palestinians .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The British undertook this project not out of love or concern for Jews - on the contrary some of the strongest supporters of Zionism were ardent anti-Semites, including Lord Balfour himself .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Europe's theoretically constructed racist, bigoted and intolerant attitudes and policies towards Jews were the primary reason for supporting Zionism .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"On this date, Palestine entered the colonial tunnel and the dispossession of its indigenous population began .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"While the 1948 Nakba led to the physical expulsion of some 750,000 Palestinians , it is the British occupation in 1917 followed by the Mandate that sealed Palestine's fate as the last colonial project to be commissioned .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thus ,  Zionism was incubated in the British colonial womb with an umbilical cord connected to Europe's settler, colonial and racist epistemology .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The British occupation made it possible for Zionism to get a foothold in Palestine .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What followed was the tormenting of the Palestinians through ethnic cleansing and expulsion , massacres, home demolitions, settlement expansions, land confiscation, everyday violence, attacks on al-Aqsa , building an Apartheid Wall and issuing more than 40 laws descriminating Palestinians .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poland's recent local elections went according to the usual script: The ruling coalition of the Civic Platform and Polish People's Party retained their control over major cities .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But there was one political surprise in the final results .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The urban movement , which ran for the first time in elections as a nationwide coalition of city activists , won the mayor's seat in Gorzow Wielkopolski, in western Poland, and a number of city council seats in big cities like Warsaw, Poznan and Torun .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although a newcomer to the electoral race , the urban movement dictated the direction of most election campaigns .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Their demands ended up in the electoral programmes of mainstream political parties , which scrambled to attract grassroot activists on their lists to capture the youth leftist vote .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So what is this new political force and can it permanently transform Polish local and state politics?  In late 2007, a group of residents of the Rataje district in Poznan, in western Poland, organised to defend their right to have a say in the planning of their neighbourhood .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The mayor of Poznan and the city council, had proposed to transform the derelict post-industrial zone of the neighbourhood into a new residential and commercial area .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Local residents, on the other hand, insisted on building a park and a recreational area .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They mobilised the community, organised protests, wrote petitions and publicised the issue in the media .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The negative publicity made the situation uncomfortable enough for local officials to concede to public pressure and withdraw their commercial development proposal .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This was the first sign that a new social force was emerging with the potential to affect urban policies in Poland through civic engagement .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grassroot activities began to surface in other Polish cities around that time .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Activists from Sopot in northern Poland started calling for participatory budgeting following the model of the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Lodz, in central Poland, an informal group of active citizens organised themselves around the issue of cleanliness of public spaces .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gradually, these groups merged into a movement calling for citizen participation in the transformation of the post-industrial area of the city, just like in Poznan .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lodz used to be an important industrial centre up until 1989 when its textile industry collapsed and many industrial buildings lay abandoned and derelict .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Warsaw, urban activists organised demonstrations for the preservation of green areas in the centre of the Polish capital; against hikes in public transport fees,;and against privatisation of municipal buildings .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the last few years , groups like Right to the City, Inhabitants' Forum , and the Housing Movement have emerged in almost every Polish town bringing together individuals of various ages, social, and cultural backgrounds .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These groups were involved in a variety of campaigns to reassert residents' rights to their neighbourhoods and towns: from writing petitions, to organising protests, pickets and demonstrations, to occupying vacant buildings, setting up squats and blocking evictions .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their political appetite grew with time .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2010, Poznan activists formed : ""We, the Inhabitants of Poznan,"" social electoral committee to contest local elections .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They received almost 10 percent of the votes , but with an electoral law favouring big political parties, they failed to get a seat on the council .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This electoral experience facilitated the launching, in 2011, of an informal coalition - the Urban Movements Congress - comprising urban activist groups from all over Poland .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The congress was tasked with formulating a programme to provide a common foundation around which urban activists would build their campaigns in local communities .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The programme was focused on three main pillars : policies to stem and reverse the growth of socioeconomic inequalities and exclusion; sustainable environment-conscious urban development in the interest of all residents; and promotion of direct democracy practices such as social consultations, participatory budgeting and referendums .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After the founding of the congress, the urban movements grew in strength and impact .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the national level, the congress managed to pressure the Ministry of Regional Development to include some of its policies in its 2012 National Urban Policy (NUP) programme .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the local level, urban activists managed to reap a number of victories .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2011, after much ""harassment"" from activists, the mayor of Sopot agreed to implement participatory budgeting in the city .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Residents now can decide on how to spend 5 million zlotys (about $1.6m) or one percent of the municipal budget .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other mayors soon followed suit .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Lodz, residents decide on how to spend 40 million zlotys ($13m) .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The mayor of Lodz also invited local activists to advise the city council's Revitalisation Bureau on specific policies for the socioeconomic development of the city .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The reason why Lodz became more accepting of the urban movement's demands was because its previous mayor was removed in a popular referendum in January 2010 .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The mayors of Czestochowa, Olsztyn, Elblag, Bytom and Ostroda were also removed in the same manner for introducing policies regarding privatisation and commercial development which went against the will of their electorates .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The same fate threatened the mayor of Warsaw , but the low turnout at the referendum saved her .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After surviving in her post , she quickly implemented some of the urban movement's demands .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the most spectacular achievement of the Polish urban movement in recent months was putting Krakow's candidacy to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games to a referendum .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After it was announced in November 2013 that local authorities had decided to put forward Krakow's candidacy for the Olympics , activists launched a campaign called Krakow Against Games , which aimed to inform people of the negative consequences of hosting big sporting event .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"City authorities caved in under popular pressure and put the decision to a referendum, with the condition that it has at least a 30 percent turnout .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Knowing that the 2010 EU elections had only a 26 percent turnout , they combined the referendum with the 2014 EU elections .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To the displeasure of local authorities , some 36 percent of Krakow's citizens voted and 70 percent of those said no to the games .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Victory of the Krakow Against Games campaign showed that referendums can be an important tool in bringing local policies in line with residents' will and that urban activists have considerable social support .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Krakow victory gave impetus to the formation by of nationwide coalition of 12 sociopolitical entities affiliated with the Urban Movements Congress to contest the 2014 local elections .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The results of the election demonstrated that the movement can translate its grassroot support into electoral victories .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the 2015 parliamentary and presidential elections approaching, the coalition is hopeful that it will have an even larger political impact in the coming year .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The urban movement has a long way to go in order to occupy a permanent place on Poland's political map , but its public presence, successful campaigns and increasing social support show that there is a definite shift in Polish people's sociopolitical attitudes .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is clearly growing support for sustainable and environment-conscious development which aims to level out inequalities and exclusion and usher in effective practices of direct democracy .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In 1904, Russia and Japan went to war over control of the Liaodong Peninsula in modern day China .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia needed a year-round ice-free port for its naval fleet and Imperial Japan saw this encroachment as a threat .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After early setbacks in the war, Russia needed to quickly reinforce its naval fleet in the Pacific Ocean with its Baltic Fleet .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If Arctic ice continues to decrease at its current rate it is possible Russia will not have this problem in the future .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each year more ships are making the journey through the Northern Sea Route .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In some cases this reduces the distance between European and north Asian ports by 30 percent .,statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While the economic advantages are obvious , the use of the Northern Sea Route offers military advantages as well .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia's interests in the Arctic go beyond the economic and military advantages offered by the Northern Sea Route .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The region is rich in minerals, wildlife, fish, and other natural resources .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some estimates claim that 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil reserves and almost one-third of the world's undiscovered natural gas reserves are located in the Arctic region .,statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The majority of these untapped resources are also in areas to which Russia lays claim .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For now , the Arctic region is an area of low conflict , and it is in everyone's interest to keep it that way .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although the security challenges currently faced in the Arctic are not military in nature , there is still a requirement for military capability in the region that can support civilian authorities .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example ,  civilian search and rescue and natural disaster response - in such an unforgiving environment as the Arctic - can be augmented by the military .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So it should be no surprise that like Russia, other Arctic countries deploy military assets into the region .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even so ,  Russia has taken steps to increase military capability in the region that seems to be beyond the scope of supporting civilian operations .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One must consider the implications of Russia's increased military presence in the region in light of Moscow's recent aggression against Ukraine .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This month, Russia activated its new Arctic command to better coordinate all Russian military activities in the Arctic .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ultimate goal for Russia to deploy a combined arms force in the Arctic by 2020 , appears to be on track .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia's primary military focus in the Arctic is in the maritime sphere .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A cause for concern .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Russian naval doctrine calls for Russia to increase its maritime presence in the Arctic .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Already, Russia's Northern Fleet , which is based in the Arctic , counts for two-thirds of the Russian navy .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There will be a significant increase of Russian ground troops based in the region too .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over the next few years two new so-called Arctic brigades will be permanently based above the Arctic Circle , and the current regiment of marines assigned to the Northern Fleet will increase by one-third .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia has plans to build 13 airfields as well as 10 radar posts along the course of the Northern Sea Route .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most of these airfields will be refurbished Soviet era bases , but others will be new .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Arctic is an area that allows Russia to flex its muscles without incurring any significant geopolitical risk .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because nationalism is on the rise in Russia , Putin's Arctic strategy is popular among the population .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russian activity in the Arctic , whether military, economic or scientific , harks back to images of Peter the Great and the Great Northern Expedition in the 18th century .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This helps Putin with his dream of bringing Russia back to its former imperial glory .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is Russia's prerogative to place military assets inside its national territory, however , these actions should be of concern to others in the region because Moscow has shown its willingness to use military force to achieve its national objectives outside its national borders .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is no secret that Russia views the South Caucasus as being in its natural sphere of influence .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In light of Russia's annexation of Crimea, and on the back of Moscow's recent treaties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgians have legitimate reasons to believe that Russian activity in their country will only increase in 2015 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Consequently ,  many are keeping a close eye on the Georgian province of Samtskhe-Javakheti - a majority ethnically Armenian region located just three hours' drive from the nation's capital city of Tbilisi .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Causing instability in Samtskhe-Javakheti would achieve two goals for Moscow .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First ,  it would further dismember the territorial integrity of Georgia .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are already under Russian occupation .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By some accounts they are closer than ever to being annexed by Moscow .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An independent Samtskhe-Javakheti, or one under Russian influence, would divide Georgia down the middle .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Armenian separatism in Samtskhe-Javakheti might not be as vocal as it was only a few years ago ; but there is still a fear that Moscow could easily reenergise separatist movements in the region .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondly, and more importantly for Russia, bringing the region under Moscow's influence would make a land corridor between Russia and Armenia, via South Ossetia, one step closer .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is important because Russia maintains a sizeable military presence in Armenia .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The bulk of the Russian force is based in the city of Gyumri and consists of approximately 5,000 soldiers and dozens of fighter planes and attack helicopters .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia has long had the difficult challenge of supplying these forces , especially since Georgia and Turkey refuse transit rights .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This has left a reliance on Iran , which for obvious reasons, is not ideal for Russia .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is not only for Russia that Samtskhe-Javakheti is strategically important, but also for Europe .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the South Caucasus Pipeline , carrying oil and gas respectively from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea , passes through the province .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the possibility of more Central Asian oil and gas finding its way to Europe becomes likely , these pipelines bypassing Russia will become a vital part of Europe's energy security .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition ,  the Kars-Tbilisi-Baku railway , which is due to open later this year , passes through Samtskhe-Javakheti .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is expected that this rail line will eventually transport 3 million passengers and over 15 million tons of freight each year .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a perfect storm brewing in the region and if Russia wanted to exploit the situation in Samtskhe-Javakheti it could not ask for better timing than now .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First is the fact that many Javakheti Armenians have Russian sympathies .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Until its closure in 2007, the Russian military base there was the single biggest source of employment .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has also been reportedthat Moscow is issuing Russian passports to ethnic Armenians living in the region .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This in itself is telling ; Russia issued passports to Abkhazians and South Ossetians just before its 2008 invasion of Georgia and also issued passports to Crimeans ahead of the annexation of Crimea last year .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But Russia is only part of the problem .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many of the grievances Javakheti Armenians have are a result of poor policy making by the central government in Tbilisi .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many Javakheti Armenians feel that their culture and language are discriminated against .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There has been a decrease in the quality of education among the Javakheti Armenian population .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The bilingual education program of teaching in both Georgian and Armenian has been described as a ""total failure"" because there are not enough qualified teachers with proficiency in both languages .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unemployment is high in Samtskhe-Javakheti and future economic prospects in the region look bleak .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many Javakheti Armenians travel to Russia or Armenia for work .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Economy strained .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks to the drop in the value of the Russian ruble - almost one-third of its value in the past year  - remittances have also decreased .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The unusually harsh winter in the region is placing a further strain on economic activity .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then there is the issue of citizenship and immigration .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many Javakheti Armenians do not have Georgian citizenship .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead ,  many hold Armenian passports because finding seasonal work in Armenia and Russia is easier this way .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Until recently, Armenian citizens were allowed to live and work inside Georgia without any special authorisation as long as they crossed the border back into Armenia at least once a year .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last September this changed .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now Javakheti Armenians without Georgian citizenship can only stay in Georgia for three months at a time .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Longer term residency permits are costly .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These policies breed animosity and form a perfect storm that could easily be exploited by Russia .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It does not have to be this way .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sensible policies can be pursued by Tbilisi to address the legitimate grievances of the Javakheti Armenians .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The West can make it clear to Russia that further meddling in Georgia's domestic affairs could lead to additional sanctions .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You have to be made of wood not to laugh at this : a private Russian bank has given a loan to France's National Front .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This political party, drawn to victory by Marine Le Pen, won the recent French elections by almost three times the number of votes than President Francois Hollande .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although this is news , this wasn't the biggest media reaction of the day .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ever since the news came out that the National Front's campaign budget was allegedly funded by the First Czech-Russian Bank , accusations that ""the Kremlin is funding the far-right"" and ""supporting anti-EU parties"" have been making the rounds .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This bank has been in operation since 1996 , which by Russian terms, makes it ""ancient"" as capitalism didn't really kick in until the mid-1990s in Russia .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Through this, the sole owner of the bank, Roman Popov, was immediately seen as the ""oligarch who is close to the Kremlin"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The funding , which initially started at a sum of $11m , quickly increased to $49m , purely because that is the amount of money the National Front said it needed in order to pay for its campaign leading up to the presidential elections in 2017 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With all the media hype, it seems as though people haven't picked up on the irony .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was running for president in 2005 , Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi also gave him a sum of money for his campaign .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But that is not the irony ; the amount of money he gave was $49m .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This doesn't appear to have crossed the minds of western hacks just yet .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That is because they have their own steadfast views and refuse to deviate from them .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to find out more , I turned to my Moscow sources for help .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But first, I got in touch with the First Czech-Russian Bank .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wanted to find out what they thought about the whole fuss that has erupted around their institution .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the staff at the bank was reluctant to comment on the loan to the National Front , citing client confidentiality .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They did, however , provide me with a direct email address to get in touch with one of the deputy chairmen , who never did respond to my request for comment .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then again , if you should try to find out something somewhat unconventional from any of the private banks in the West , you'd also be met with silence or at best, claims of data protection .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My sources in Moscow did a bit of their own research and told me that the First Czech-Russian Bank was actually launched on the initiative of the Czech government .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At some point later on, one of the shareholders was the Russian construction company Stroitransgaz ; translated into English , the name means ""Gas Pipeline Construction"" .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The current owner of the bank, Roman Popov, used to work there .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While Popov was head of the Finance Department (1992-2002) , Stroitransgaz was a subcontractor for Gazprom, the giant state-owned gas and oil corporation in Russia .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was probably because of that , that western hacks came to the conclusion that Popov is ""directly linked to the Kremlin"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The journalists' suspicions are further fuelled by the fact that Popov generally keeps a low profile and does not boast about his football club in England or his basketball team in the US or his real-estate profile , which is worth millions in Western Europe .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The bank also has two representative offices; one in Prague and one in Bratislava , which would be logical if the name of your bank included the word ""Czech"" .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My sources in Moscow informed me that the First Czech-Russian bank is quite a good bank and has a very decent track record , which is no mean feat for a financial institution that dates back to 1996 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has had no substantial bail outs from the Central Bank and survived the banking crash of 2007 with flying colours .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As for the owner, the best I could find out is that he has a degree in financial management and has been of late developing business beyond corporate entities and individual customers in Russia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No word on why he gave the go-ahead to give the loan to the National Front , but even if he did , why not? If the interest is good and the chances of getting it back are high as well , it sounds like a fair deal .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not to mention that it's a perfectly legitimate political party , which enjoys greater support than the ruling party at present .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most recent opinion poll has shown that Le Pen would win the first round of the presidential elections if they were held tomorrow .,statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The question is , of course , did Popov bargain on all the publicity that his bank would be getting once word gets out that he has been funding an anti-EU and anti-immigration political part in France? Well, it might be that he thought that some publicity for his bank might actually attract more clients and raise his bank's profile .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let's face it , if a party gets 25 percent in the national vote , like the National Front did in the European elections this year , it means that a lot of people see it as a better bet than the other parties , which in turn means that the potential client base is substantial .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Russia itself, the National Front is not seen as ""racist"" or ""fascist"", as some sections of the French media portray it .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In doing so , they seem to forget that by labelling this party as racists and fascists , they also label 25 percent of the French electorate as racists and fascists .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Later on, particularly during the Vietnam War, the revisionists (William Appleman Williams) challenged that view blaming the US for the Cold War , arguing that : ""America's chief aim in the years after the war was to make sure that there was an 'open door' for American trade , and that this led the American government to try to make sure that countries remained capitalist like the United States.""  Then there were the post-revisionists (John Lewis Gaddis) in the 1970s who believed that : ""America and Russia wanted to keep the peace after the war but that conflict was caused by mutual misunderstanding, reactivity, and above all the American inability to understand Stalin's fears and need to defend himself after the war.""  The latter is the closest guide to today's problems .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the specificities of the current period is that the West considers Russia to be both part of the solution but part of the problem as well .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What's surprising is that it was just one and a half minutes long .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The buzz on the internet surrounding the new Star Wars trailer is showing that the franchise is assuredly a force to outmatch cat videos or even Kim Kardashian .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's almost four decades since George Lucas redefined blockbuster cinema with the original Star Wars - and despite his own attempts to undermine his legacy with a trio of poorly conceived prequels - the juggernaut shows no sign of slowing down .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Revitalised under the helm of JJ Abrams (Lost, the Star Trek reboots) and in the hands of Disney , the new movie is building its hype very early indeed .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The teaser trailer hit our screens a full year before the movie itself is scheduled to be released .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This triggered everything from frame by frame breakdowns by respectable newspapers, to a deluge of parodies (the Lego version is a favourite ; while the George Lucas version will appeal to geeks) .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even the Middle East's favourite home-grown parody site, the Pan Arabia Enquirer, got in the action , deftly skewering the Facebook updates and tweets from UAE residents adamant that the sand dunes of Abu Dhabi commanded the starring role in the new teaser .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So heaven knows what they'd make of an entire column on the subject .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because the thing is , the franchise has always had a long, if not entirely comfortable, relationship with the Middle East .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the first movie, scenes taking place on the desert world, Tatooine, were famously shot in Tunisia ; the fictional planet is even named after the Tunisian city of Tatouine as homage .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By all accounts, the shoot there was difficult, with unseasonal rainstorms slowing production and sandstorms blitzing the complicated props .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Still that didn't stop the director from returning in 1997 to film scenes from the first prequel there ; the props and sets left behind from both shoots remain a tourist draw to this day .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not much better were the scavenging, hustling Jawas , piloting a giant slave ship for robots around the dunes; or the Mos Eisley Cantina, a bar drawn straight from the malaria-fevered imaginations of an old colonial soak returned from some mythical Kasbah in the mystical Orient .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Far more troubling, though, was the repulsive Watto from the disappointing prequel, ""The Phantom Menace"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A slave-owning, money-obsessed trader, Watto has the singular honour of being roundly criticised as both an anti-Arab and an anti-Jewish stereotype .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Patricia J Williams , writing in the The Nation said simply that the character was ""more comprehensively anti-Semitic - both anti- Arab and anti-Jew"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, should there be mixed feelings in this part of the world that the trailer opens with a shot of the Empty Quarter, and continues with a very opening-of- Lawrence of Arabia shot of a young woman on a speeder bike?  Actually, no .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abu Dhabi can be confident that , even if Watto returns , commanding an entire army of Sand People against our noble heroes , (just wait for Lucas' extended version for that scene) the experience will still be net positive in terms of bringing in visitors and establishing itself further as a major film destination .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dangerous stereotypes .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Besides ,  narratives are outside the control of a host country , even when they choose not to host .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The emirate washed its hands of one Hollywood venture, and still managed to get tarred with a very unpleasant brush .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abu Dhabi very sensibly blocked the filming of the woeful ""Sex in the City 2"" on its territory , forcing the film-makers to use Morocco instead , while still setting the action in ""Abu Dhabi"" and thus indelibly linking the emirate to an abysmal film memorably panned by the BBC's Mark Kermode as ""consumerist pornography"" and ""an orgy of dripping wealth that made me want to be sick"" .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of course , there will always be the argument that Star Wars is simply entertainment , and it doesn't do any favours to delve too deep into subplots and symbolism from what is essentially a kids' movie .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What could be more far-fetched than that?,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On December 7, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced a huge hike in military expenditure for the next fiscal year .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Though he described the budget presented to parliament as ""cautious"" and ""tight"" , military spending is to rise by 33.5 percent, far above the six percent increase in the general budget .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This will likely result in a greater military footprint in the region, particularly in Syria and Iraq , where Iranian troops are directly involved in combat, training, logistics and intelligence-gathering (Tehran this week expanded its operations in Iraq to include air strikes) .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is also likely meant as a show of strength and defiance against Iran's regional rivals .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  it is doubtful that Tehran can economically sustain its existing regional military commitments, let alone expand them .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Crippling sanctions and a massive drop in oil prices mean a much larger military budget will put further strain on the economy , which has reportedly shrunk by 8.6 percent over the past two fiscal years .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This is worrying news for the government , whose revenues are largely dependent on oil .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition ,  western sanctions have caused Iran's oil exports to plummet compared with a few years ago .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last year, the oil minister said the fall in exports was costing the country up to $8bn each month .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iran reportedly lost some $26bn in oil revenue in 2012 .,statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"There has been an easing of sanctions in light of negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme , but it is limited .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given that the talks have been extended by several months , the bulk of the sanctions will remain in place at least until then, with no indication as yet that a deal is within reach .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sanctions could be reinstated or increased if the talks fail .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All this amounts to an economy that cannot keep up with Iran's regional ambitions .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The hike in military spending may arouse domestic anger if it is seen by Iranians as spurred by foreign ventures , which is already a cause of increasing frustration , particularly with regard to propping up the Syrian regime .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While Tehran is secretive about the extent of its military and financial assistance to its regional allies , there is a consensus that it has been a considerable economic drain, not least because of the long-term nature of these commitments .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tehran's direct military involvement in Iraq is viewed by many Iranians as necessary to stop the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) from reaching its borders .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"While the latter are also affected by falling oil prices , they are not under sanctions .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore ,  according to the International Monetary Fund, Iran and Russia need a much higher oil price to balance their budgets than Arab Gulf states, key backers of Syrian rebels .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Senate Intelligence Committee's scathing torture report not only described the brutality of the CIA's interrogation methods, but also demonstrated their ineffectiveness .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Led by ex-Vice President Dick Cheney , former Bush administration officials have rushed to the airwaves to defend the CIA .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""I would do it again in a minute,"" Cheney said on NBC's Meet the Press , claiming that Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (EITs) produced ""actionable intelligence that kept us safe from attacks"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cheney & Co may not win the debate , but they have succeeded in muddying the waters .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That is unfortunate because , beneath their bombastic caricatures of the torture programme, there's more agreement than first appears among people who actually count .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aside from former officials trying to save their reputations , it isn't one camp saying torture didn't ""work"" and one saying it did .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rather , it's one camp saying it didn't , and the other saying ""we have no idea but did it anyway"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On several key points, the CIA is closer in substance to the Senate report than to its loudest defenders .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'Unprepared' for torture .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Senate report found that the CIA was ""unprepared"" to operate a detention and interrogation system .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Agency's written response to the report says ; ""We fully agree"" - the CIA had ""no cadre of trained and experienced interrogators, little experience handling and moving prisoners, and no core competency in prison management .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[...] The Agency had too few analysts and linguists with the expertise required to support [a detention] programme"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In other words ,  there is no dispute that the programme was started and run on the fly .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A critical finding of the Senate report was that torturing detainees did not yield otherwise unobtainable actionable intelligence .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CIA director, John O Brennan, admitted that the agency ""has not concluded that it was the use of EITs that allowed us to obtain useful information from detainees"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So while the CIA still maintains that it gained valuable intelligence from detainees , it is not saying the abusive methods produced it .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Senate report also describes how the CIA sought out two psychiatrists, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen , to construct the torture programme instead of actual experienced interrogators , on the assumption that long-established humane and lawful interrogation methods wouldn't work .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In its response, the CIA acknowledged that it had to look beyond the agency to find experts on ""non-standard means of interrogation"" since it was not an area of expertise that CIA officers or the US government possessed .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The CIA called Mitchell and Jessen's background ""so unique"" that the agency ""would have been derelict had [it] not sought them out when it became clear that CIA would be heading into the uncharted territory of the programme"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In other words ,  the torture programme was so out of whack with what professional interrogators do that the CIA had to go outside the US government to find people to do it .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There still are important areas of disagreement between the Senate report and the CIA .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The CIA is too protective of its own to acknowledge the full import of its descent into torture or to disavow the programme entirely .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the agency - unlike its loudest defenders - is not endorsing torture as a means of gaining intelligence or keeping the country safe .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To be sure , basing the case against torture on its total ineffectiveness is a risky proposition .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Torture produces a lot of information and while victims frequently make things up to ease their suffering , they may also on occasion say things of some value .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's why it is important to remember that torture is illegal under any circumstances regardless of its utility .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But in a democracy, the strength of legal norms depends partly on their acceptance by the public .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So while the public shouldn't have to be persuaded that barbaric methods fail to make them safer , doing so reinforces their illegality .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The flurry of media appearances by Cheney and other torture defenders has created a false sense that there is a genuine divide over whether torture ""works"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But neither the CIA nor professional interrogators actually say that .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So while we can continue to debate other aspects of the CIA programme , including whether those responsible should be sanctioned , let's stop pretending that there are two legitimate sides to this particular story .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The case of Abu Zubaydah has long been known .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amnesty International first raised its concerns with the US government in April 2002 .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was the first person to be taken into CIA custody considered by the agency to have high intelligence value .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abu Zubaydah was effectively treated as a human guinea pig to test the CIA's emerging interrogation regime .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He was subjected to a range of torture methods, including being waterboarded multiple times .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The SSCI summary adds some new chilling details .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A July 15, 2002 cable sent by the interrogation team at ""Detention Site Green"", believed to be in Thailand , ended : ""In light of the planned psychological pressure techniques to be implemented , we need to get reasonable assurances that [Abu Zubaydah] will remain in isolation and incommunicado for the remainder of his life."" CIA officers responded that ""all major players are in concurrence that [Abu Zubaydah] should remain incommunicado for the rest of his life"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then , after Abu Zubaydah had been subjected to 47 days of complete isolation , he was subjected to numerous ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" including physical assaults, stress positions, cramped confinement, white noise, and sleep deprivation ""in varying combinations, 24 hours a day for 17 straight days"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reports were constantly fed back to top authorities .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daily cables sent from ""Detention Site Green"" to CIA headquarters recorded that Abu Zubaydah frequently ""cried"", ""begged"", ""pleaded"", and ""whimpered"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At times, he was ""hysterical"" and ""distressed to the level that he was unable to effectively communicate"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Waterboarding sessions would result in ""hysterical pleas"" , and on at least one occasion, Abu Zubaydah ""became completely unresponsive"" until he received medical attention .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abu Zubaydah's ordeal is not yet over .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After four and a half years in secret CIA custody he was transferred to Guantanamo , where he remains today .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He has never been charged with any crime .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The injustice continues .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On August 5, 2002, at the same time that Abu Zubaydah was being tortured in Thailand , CIA headquarters approved an interrogation plan for Ridha al-Najjar at another secret facility, dubbed ""Detention Site Cobalt"" , believed to be the Salt Pit facility in Afghanistan .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The interrogation plan for Najjar included isolation in total darkness , lowering the quality of his food, keeping him in cold temperatures, 24-hour-a-day loud music, shackling and hooding .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over one two-day period, he was left with his wrists handcuffed to an overhead bar for 22 hours a day in order to ""break his resistance"" .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On September 21, 2002, his interrogators sent a cable describing Najjar as ""clearly a broken man"" and ""on the verge of complete breakdown"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His detention and interrogation ""became the model"" for the treatment of detainees at that facility, according to the SSCI .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Twelve years later, Najjar remains in US custody in Bagram, Afghanistan .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He has never been charged or tried, and is still being denied his right to challenge his detention in court .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A petition on his behalf is currently pending before the US Supreme Court .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The psychological impact of such intense cruelty has devastated those subjected to it .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to the SSCI, many detainees ""exhibited psychological and behavioural issues, including hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, and attempts at self-harm and self-mutilation"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Majid Khan , who was held in secret CIA custody for three and a half years before being transferred in 2006 to Guantanamo , where he remains today , is said to have engaged in numerous acts of self-harm , including ""attempting to cut his wrist on two occasions , to chew into his arm at the inner elbow , cut a vein in the top of his foot and into his skin at the elbow joint using a filed toothbrush"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Amnesty International believes this should be done sooner rather than later ,  indeed should be set in motion now .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Senate committee also needs to address the fact that the US human rights violations and crimes went beyond torture .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The CIA detainees were subjected to enforced disappearance  - which, like torture, is a crime under international law .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No one has been brought to justice for these crimes .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This accountability gap leaves the US squarely on the wrong side of its international obligations .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Those responsible, no matter their current or previous level of office, must be brought to justice, along with those in other countries that colluded with the CIA to facilitate these programmes .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The US ratified the treaty in 1994 .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"President Obama should make a public commitment to end the impunity being enjoyed by those who authorised and carried out the crimes committed in the CIA programmes of rendition, interrogation and detention .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"But recently, because of the quick succession of the failures to indict the killers of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, and then the release of the torture report , we are at a moment in which the link between our domestic terrorism and our international terrorism is being drawn for the rest of us .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Immediately after the release of the report, many in the media did their best to claim that the release of this report was part of some wider conspiracy to demoralise Americans .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The best example of this would be Fox News' Andrea Tantaros , who, in the middle of a conversation about the report, began shouting that ""The United States of America is awesome , we are awesome."" She seemed positively indignant that the Obama administration was attempting to ""have this discussion to show us how we're not awesome"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For those unfamiliar with the slang of US hipsters and teenagers, we generally use the ""awesome/not awesome"" binary to evaluate things like pizza, beer, or surfboards - not the moral character of a nation-state .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But , if we are to adopt her method of expression , Tantaros seems to be forgetting that she is able to be on television in part because one or two generations ago, a few people declared that women not being able to participate in news media was not very ""awesome"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She also forgets that a couple generations before that, her Greek last name would have prevented her from being considered ""white"" , and she thus would not have been allowed in front of a camera .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whether Tantaros accepts it or not , the history of equality in the US has been one of people deciding that things were not yet awesome , and taking it upon themselves to make them more awesome .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But we should note that Tantaros was primarily angry at being forced to have a public conversation , and at being embarrassed that the world was seeing us have a discussion about our behaviour .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""And all this does is have our enemies laughing at us.""  Not only is torture illegal , but by US' own standards, it is ineffective .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The CIA knew this .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This ended up being true - we now know that one prisoner told the CIA that he was trying to recruit black Muslims in the US to attack gas stations .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If the timing of the one-two punch of public revelations of anti-black racism and criminal torture do not convince us , then we can at least recognise a pattern in the people that are desperate to deny both .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The torture report is available to anyone to view online , provided they are willing to wade through pages and pages of gruesome accounts .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This is the same Peter King who said that Eric Garner did not die because of a chokehold , but because he was overweight .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is also the same Peter King that implied that Garner, in his final moments, was lying about not being able to breathe .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If Tantaros' reaction to the defiling of the ""awesomeness"" of the US seems childish , Peter King's reaction is worse .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In the 1990s, crime was on the rise in Kenya .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mungiki is a Kikuyu word for multitude .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The organisation had both a cultural and political element to it .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In 2002, the Kenyan government banned 18 of these criminal gangs .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The spread of Mungiki's influence forced the government in 2007 to establish a special police unit called Kwekwe which was tasked primarily with hunting down members of Mungiki .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most alarming is the concern that foreign-run Ebola treatment centres could be using unorthodox testing methods with impunity .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Emergency's use of Amiodarone without a proper clinical trial or patient consent prompted censure from a senior scientist about the recklessness of this approach and a walk-out over safety fears by the UK health workers sent to work at the treatment centre .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The streets of major US cities are not filled with anti-war demonstrations , yet the apparent quiet does not signify consent .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A look at history shows why .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The US has been attacked on domestic territory twice in the past century .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan bombed Pearl Harbour , killing 2,403 Americans and wounding 1,178 others .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The next day, US Congress voted to declare war on Japan , thus committing to active hostilities in World War II .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That declaration of war has since proved to be the last in the history of the US .,common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The next and last mass scale violent attack by an outside aggressor on the domestic territory of the US occurred 13 years ago, on September 11, 2001, with the immediate death toll approaching 3,000 .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Three days later, Congress adopted an Authorisation for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against those held responsible for the September 11 attacks .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In so doing , Congress delegated war-making powers to President George W Bush under the terms of the War Powers Act of 1973 .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
December 7 and September 11 are notable in part because in both cases horrendous violence against the people of the US was responded to with an act of Congress .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oppose or support US entry into either of those wars, question or affirm that those wars were lawful , there was no question in either case that Congress had signed off on them .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Congressional approval .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It mattered that Congress approve , because Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution accords primary war powers, including the power to commence and end war , to Congress alone .",common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For a president of the US to make war without congressional approval was an unthinkable act that would have threatened the legitimacy of the federal government .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With his war on the so-called Islamic State , US President Barack Obama has committed that unthinkable act , and Congress has let him .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And yet ,  by all appearances, no one outside of a handful of members of Congress, legal scholars, and peace activists has spoken out in protest .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contrast this moment with that of the weeks and months following September 11 .,other,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On September 29, 2001, upwards of 25,000 people marched through Washington, DC, against the impending invasion of Afghanistan ; tens of thousands demonstrated elsewhere throughout the US .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By April 20, 2002, the anti-war protest in Washington drew over 150,000 .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By February 15, national protest turnout hit 2 million .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given this history, one cannot conclude that the size and volume of anti-war protests directly resulted from the relative popularity of a particular war .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After all ,  the 2001-2003 protests erupted and swelled over a period in which polls showed continued strong support among the US public for Washington's war operations .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And in fact, as in 2003-2008 public opinion turned against the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the size and volume of anti-war movement went down .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The simple and correct explanation for this history is that anti-war organisers made decisions in 2001, 2002, and 2003 , to focus their energies on mobilising street protests , and that in the years 2004-2008 , as anti-war sentiment was taken up by a majority of the American people , many anti-war organisers shifted much of their focus to electing anti-war candidates to office .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What has changed since Obama assumed the presidency? In Washington, in terms of war and security, very little .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Having lived and struggled through this history , why would anti-war organisers choose to respond to Washington's undeclared, unauthorised war against the so - called Islamic State by mobilising street protests? Why would they mobilise to elect anti-war candidates?  The core of the peace movement remains active in many parts of the US .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Every day I receive notices about civil disobedience at military bases, hunger strikes, local government resolutions calling for a shift in spending priorities away from the military, and much more .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Among Fanon's sober assessments is that colonialism ""is violence in its natural state , and it will only yield when confronted with greater violence"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""Decolonisation , which sets out to change the order of the world , is, obviously, a programme of complete disorder"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The film corroborates these assertions with footage from former European colonial possessions in Africa .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scenes variously depict the subjugation and impoverishment of native populations, juxtaposed with Europeans sun-tanning and playing golf in picturesque African settings in between wantonly extracting resources and imprisoning and torturing people .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This, in turn, provides the proper context for scenes of militant African resistance .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Particularly illustrative of the prevailing ""order of the world"" is an interview with a white settler in then-Rhodesia who addresses his black servant boy as ""you stupid thing, you"" and laments the impending African reclamation of the territory : ""The gooks have got it.""  When asked by the interviewer to clarify his derogatory slang , he elaborates with more slang: ""The terrs ... The whole world is supporting the terrorists.""  To be sure , we've superficially done away with the whole colonialism business, it being generally understood that colonies are bad and archaic things .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are, however, notable exceptions to the rule, as in the case of state of Israel , which is granted a de facto exemption from ceasing colonial operations and is furthermore regularly lauded as a beacon of democracy .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the same oppressive structures that underpinned colonialism continue to flourish in the age of neoliberal globalisation , which functions according to the idea that there is a class of human beings - often but not always determined by skin colour - entitled to a level of wealth and comfort that is only attainable by depriving the global masses of a dignified existence .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poor Africans might be forgiven for failing to detect enormous differences between this and previous intrusions from abroad .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In other parts of the world that the US prefers to think of as its own personal military base - such as Central America - the imperial power has backed the security forces of various repressive and illegitimate leaders committed to violently squelching popular protest .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reasons for protest have included government insistence on catering to foreign corporations rather than to indigenous and peasant communities opposed to the usurpation and contamination of their lands by mining operations and the like .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the victims are largely invisible, the dehumanised refuse of empire and the price to be paid for securing corporate profit .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In her spoken preface to Concerning Violence, renowned Columbia University professor Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak explains that in ""reading between the lines"" of The Wretched of the Earth, one sees that Fanon does not in fact endorse violence but rather ""insists that the tragedy is that the very poor is reduced to violence , because there is no other response possible to an absolute absence of response and an absolute exercise of legitimised violence from the colonisers"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Spivak goes on to make a telling comparison regarding the earth's ""wretched"" : ""Their lives count as nothing against the death of the colonisers: unacknowledged Hiroshimas against sentimentalised 9/11s.""  For another modern-day example of legitimised violence and self-victimisation by the very purveyors of said violence, it seems appropriate to once again bring up the state of Israel , which shares the ex-Rhodesian resident's knack for hallucinating himself into a position of unparalleled suffering at the hands of ""terrorists"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Following last month's Jerusalem synagogue attack in which two Palestinians murdered five Israelis , there was a typical upsurge in terror-hysteria from the Israeli establishment and sympathetic governments and media .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Studiously ignored were the various Israeli crimes that directly preceded the event , not to mention this summer's slaughter of more than 2,100 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile , Israel's primary benefactor - the nation described by Fanon as the ""former European colony [that] decided to catch up with Europe"" - should find much to reflect on in Concerning Violence , particularly given Fanon's conclusion regarding the European experiment : ""It succeeded so well that the United States of America became a monster , in which the taints, the sickness, and the inhumanity of Europe have grown to appalling dimensions.""  Contemporary manifestations of the American sickness include the recent decision by a Missouri grand jury not to indict a police officer for killing an unarmed black teenager in the city of Ferguson - far from an isolated instance of fatal bigotry .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Drawing on several of Fanon's texts , journalist Roqayah Chamseddine penned an essay on the aftermath of the Ferguson decision for Al-Akhbar English , in which she condemned the liberal American tradition of placing the onus of non- violence on those oppressed by the state rather than the state itself - an entity that engages in ""unfettered police brutality and judicial discrimination"" against black communities .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This tradition entails an obsession with containing potentially ""violent"" black reactions to state violence (eg vandalism and looting) , and ultimately prescribes a superior concern for private property and material goods than for black life .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"During such periods, the Afghan Constitution allows the president to issue decrees for emergency purposes , but the Constitution also requires such decrees to be forwarded to parliament for approval .",common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some women activists nonetheless suggested that it was not necessary to send the EVAW law to parliament .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Political climate .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Others, including myself, argued that although the Executive Order on EVAW was a significant step in the battle for the elimination of violence against women , the law remained vulnerable to being reversed by a new president .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  presidential elections were just around the corner .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the drawdown of the international troops drew nearer , we feared that the political climate would make it increasingly difficult to get the law anchored in parliament .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition ,  we feared that any peace talks with the Taliban could end up sacrificing EVAW in a bid to appease the militants .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Securing parliamentary approval for the law would give us much stronger ammunition in protecting it against extremist attacks .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to get an agreement on the EVAW law in parliament , we worked tirelessly for months , using three main strategies .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, we started a lobbying campaign with those who opposed the law, mainly conservatives .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondly, we went to visit them in their houses , explaining the law to them article by article to obtain their signature in support of the law .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also organised exchange visits for conservative MPs to other Muslim countries so they could explore how these countries had been enforcing similar legislation for decades .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finally we worked through the joint committee in parliament for more than two years to develop a consensus on the law and defuse the opposition of conservatives .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In late 2009, there were only two issues left where conservative MPs did not agree .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These were the law's punishment of relatives for underage marriage and for polygamy under certain conditions as well as the fact that women's rights advocates wanted to include ""honour killings"" as a specific crime in the law .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At this point , however ,  MPs became increasingly preoccupied with the then- upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for Spring 2010 , thus the process lost momentum .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unfortunately, after the 2010 parliamentary elections, we ended up with a more conservative parliament .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contested election results left the new parliament paralysed for almost a year .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a consequence, discussions about the EVAW law only resumed in mid-2011 .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At this time the draft was re-sent to the 18 parliamentary commissions .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All but one of the commissions agreed with the text of the law or presented constructive suggestions .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The final commission, the legislative (Taqnin) committee, headed by the foremost opponent of the EVAW law, submitted 34 pages of suggested amendments .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some of these suggestions were helpful and were duly included, such as a proposal to have specialised prosecution units in all of Afghanistan .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As before, we rejected the proposals to leave underage marriage and the contraction of invalid polygamous marriages as non-punishable acts .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We similarly rejected a new suggestion which was to close all women's shelters and arrange for the victims of violence to stay with relatives instead .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although the opponents were vocal , they did not outnumber the rest .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What was damaging , however ,  was an unhealthy political rivalry that ensued among mostly female parliamentarians and supporters of EVAW .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some progressive women's rights activists, including some from international organisations, argued that the time was not right to pass the EVAW and that it should be left as a presidential decree .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were good reasons for seeking parliamentary approval .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet some of my colleagues began accusing me of using the bill to further my own political career and gain support for my assumed ambitions for the 2014 presidential elections .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead of supporting EVAW , many female MPs stood silent during the parliamentary debates on the bill and some even went as far as to lobby against it .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result , when the law was presented to the plenary in May 2013 , conservative MPs who were opposed to EVAW were further emboldened .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The new Speaker of the House did not hold a lot a lot of influence and probably, for that reason, did not back the bill either .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the conservative MPs entrenched in their opposition to EVAW, a weak speaker and a lack of support from my fellow female MPs, the EVAW bill failed to pass .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Those of us who saw the passing of EVAW to be beyond politics , and understood its importance for tackling violence against women , were left heartbroken .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the international community now gradually disengaging from Afghanistan, time is running out for Afghan women .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We have made important gains since 2001 , but we need the force of the law behind us to sustain our achievements .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We need to arm ourselves with solid laws like the EVAW law to fight the violence and other ills of our society which are destroying the souls of our sisters across the country .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The fact that the EVAW law has not been approved by the parliament is the reason for its weak implementation rates ; many justice officials are questioning the law's status and therefore do not apply it .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One promising thing on the horizon is that we now have a president and chief executive who both understand the multitude of challenges facing women .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would like to take this opportunity and call on President Ashraf Ghani and our Chief Executive Dr Abdullah Abdullah to declare their support for the passage of the EVAW bill .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I also call on my female colleagues in parliament and all Afghan women rights activists and our international partners to set aside their differences and join us in support of the ratification of the bill .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the recent parliamentary approval of the BSA shows , when the government and others make something a priority , the conservative MPs can be isolated .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Times may be difficult now for Afghanistan , differences may be wide and security challenges are growing , but failure to back the EVAW and allowing it to die will deal a severe blow to Afghan women's rights .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"To many people overseas, the United States government is viewed as an aggressive empire of military bases, drones, and special forces that transcend national borders .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But to big corporations, the US government is a patsy that gives away trillions of dollars of natural resources, tax revenues and public assets to grasping giant companies and industries .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The US has an unsurpassed record of transferring what belongs to all Americans to a few giant business interests .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In 1986, for example, a gold company found over $9bn worth of gold under federal land in Nevada .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The company bought rights to that gold for $5 per acre (less than $6,000 total) without having to pay any royalties on the mined gold back to the Department of Interior .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For over 100 years, valuable minerals worth hundreds of billions of dollars have been given away to the mining industry for $5 or less per acre .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The public airwaves belong to the people .,common-ground,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  under a law passed in 1934 by the radio lobby (sustained later by the television industry), the broadcasting stations control their licensed portion of the broadcast spectrum 24/7 for free .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As tenants they pay nothing to the Federal Communications Commission , which represents the landlords , who are the people .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These free licenses allow radio and television stations to exclusively decide who gets airtime and who does not .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Entertainment and advertisements now make up over 90 percent of the broadcasting time of these very profitable commercial stations , using our public airwaves .",statistics,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For many decades, the federal government has used taxpayer-funded research and development as hand-outs for private industries in the US .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For instance ,  the research and development of the Pentagon has resulted in technologies that built the aero-space, computer and containerisation industries .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is money that could have been spent to create and improve neighbourhood recreational facilities for participatory sports and healthy exercise .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Under those corporate subsidies, the taxpayers are paying far too much (sometimes between $100,000 to $200,000 per job) for their governments' race to the bottom during these bidding wars .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A spectre is haunting Germany and Europe and the spectre is called PEGIDA .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Until recently only a few people had heard of PEGIDA, acronym for ""Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the Occident."" It started as a small protest movement in the eastern city of Dresden against the influx of immigrants, foreign workers and asylum seekers and, above all, against the ""Islamisation"" of Germany .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Adopting the slogan ""We are the people"" of the weekly anti-communist demonstrations in 1989 which ultimately led to the overthrow of the German Democratic Republic , PEGIDA's appeal seems to have grown week after week .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Besides Dresden, there are now similar weekly rallies in other big German cities .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With its history of anti-Semitism and fascism many find it shocking that a considerable number of Germans, particularly in the east of the country, are flocking to a xenophobic, racist and Islamophobic movement .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The surge of the anti-Islamisation movement has led to polarisation of the public opinion, many counter demonstrations and a fierce public debate, involving politicians, church leaders and academics .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chancellor Angela Merkel strongly criticised PEGIDA and called on Germans not to attend their rallies .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The poor feel marginalised and not represented.""  The CSU, Merkel's CDU's sister party and longtime political ally, has been accused of showing a bit too much understanding for PEGIDA .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact the CSU's positions on immigration, integration and tougher rules for asylum seekers are quite similar to PEGIDA's .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It may well be that the CSU is distancing itself from Merkel because it is worried about right-wing competitors like the anti-establishment and eurosceptic AfD, Alternative fur Deutschland (Germany's Alternative) .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The AfD may succeed in winning over many of the PEGIDA-sympathisers .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"AfD-chairman Bernd Lucke has gone out of his way to advocate a dialogue with this ""new civil movement"" and listen carefully to its arguments .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the same time Lucke tried carefully not to alienate the more ""respectable"" right-wing voters and to distance himself from a too xenophobic discourse .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other AfD leaders are less ambiguous and clearly show support of PEGIDA by participating in their marches and inviting PEGIDA organisers to Saxony's regional parliament .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some German observers don't doubt the existence of an alliance between AfD and PEGIDA .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Analyst Volker Wagener sees the AfD as the ""parliamentary voice of the street"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He notes that the AfD manages to score with a xenophobic discourse especially in the east of Germany .,testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If the AfD succeeds in translating PEGIDA's objectives politically and electorally , it may take a role not unsimilar to Marine le Pen's National Front in France and especially Geert Wilders' Freedom Party in the Netherlands .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  there is a striking similarity between the anti- Islamisation positions of Geert Wilders and PEGIDA .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Sydney siege saw a slew of Muslim organisations issue statements condemning Islamic extremism .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Such chastisement had meant something in the wake of 9/11 and the Bali bombings .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Today, this has degraded into an automated knee-jerk response .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It has been said so many times that its gravitas is greatly diminished .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More subtly , this expectation for Muslims to keep speaking out is nothing short of Islamophobic .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It assumes that Islam is, at its core, evil .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It also upholds the view that Muslims can be essentialised as a monolithic whole .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chastisement thus becomes the yardstick from which the wider world is to differentiate between a good Muslim and a bad Muslim .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Surely today, fourteen years after 9/11, we have wisened up to the fact that such atrocious acts are committed out of political, even criminal, intent more than theology .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Surely ,  it is not a stretch to think that no one individual can represent an entire faith community . Surely ,  it is time , as Max Fisher of Vox argues , to stop asking Muslims to condemn terrorism .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the same manner, this good Muslim, bad Muslim binary undergirds the #illridewithyou campaign .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, the hashtag was borne out of goodwill ; an Asian Australian woman started it , as the Twitter universe reacted to the story of a woman pledging to walk in solidarity with another woman who took her hijab off following news of the Sydney siege .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We will protect the good Muslims, so gestures the campaign .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unfortunately, it also reproduces an age-old trope that has been highlighted by scholars of postcolonial studies .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As western colonisers encounter non-European natives , they began to think of their ""other"" in one of two antithetical ways - either as a barbaric savage or a noble savage .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Untouched by modernisation , the noble savage should be admired and protected .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hashtag #illridewithyou is just as patronising .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Another factor that cast doubt to #illridewithyou relates to this question : Was the perpetrator Man Haron Monis the quintessential Islamic extremist? If the slate of profile pieces that are now just flooding our newsfeed can be taken as a gauge , the jury is still out on this .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At first glance, one may indeed be tempted to fit him into the mould of what some security experts have called ""bedroom jihadists"", a fashionable term to describe self-radicalised individuals who have been recruited online to plan and execute terror attacks that would advance the cause of clandestine Islamist organisations .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yet Monis was a man of many masks .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Closer inspection would reveal that he does not nestle comfortably into this category .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"At this juncture, it is doubtful if he had even made contact with ISIL .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let us also not forget that Monis was not a nobody who was secretly being turned to the ways of ISIL or any other Islamist agenda .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  he was a well-known criminal .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not only had Monis been charged with being an accessory to the brutal murder of his wife last year , he had also been slapped with 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition ,  information has surfaced that he had been charged with fraud in Iran , which requested his extradition from Australia some 14 years ago .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a friend rightly pointed out on social media , Monis' criminal records qualify him as a ""sexual predator and misogynist"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same can be observed of the reaction to the mass killings committed by the Norwegian Anders Breivik in 2011 .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While Breivik had claimed himself a baptised Christian in his 1,500-page manifesto , the world did not expect Christians to condemn terrorism in the same way Muslims had .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"While denizens of Tunis debate whether interim President Moncef Marzouki or Ben Ali era veteran Beji Caid Essebsi can best move the country forward , security forces in Cairo fired on crowds who attempted to enter Tahrir Square, the erstwhile centre of the revolution, to protest the Mubarak decision , killing at least one person while arresting dozens .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The untold thousands of peaceful protesters and activists rotting in Egypt's jails and the cult of personality today surrounding President Abdel Fattah el - Sisi tell the story of how the reluctant decision by Tahrir's revolutionaries to agree to a military-led transition turned out .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Tunisia, the elements of the state, such as the interior ministry, remain bastions of the ancien regime .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the country has undeniably moved further than any Arab country towards a real and sustainable democracy .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This should not surprise anyone familiar with Tunisia's history , as the country boasts the Arab - indeed, Muslim  - world's first modern constitution, from 1861, and has long been among the most cosmopolitan and open in the region .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But the central issue today is precisely how the country built its post-Ben Ali leadership .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whatever one wants to say about the Islamist Nahda Party , its spiritual and political leader Rachid Ghannoushi re-entered Tunisian politics with a long history of supporting pluralism and democracy .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And when it was clear that the party could not govern effectively , it ceded power and agreed to new elections , while members have engaged in public self-criticism about its failings .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Equally if not more important , Marzouki is one of the Arab world's most respected human rights figures , whose Congress for the Republic Party has brought together various opposition tendencies since its creation in 2001 .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His term in office has been far from a sterling success - it could not have been otherwise , given the Herculean task of building a new governing system on the still functioning body of Ben Ali's mafia state .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But despite political assassinations, flaring religious extremism, and deep- seated economic problems , the country has moved to solidify a new civil and democratic political system .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The contrast with the Egyptian post-revolutionary leadership couldn't be clearer .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are many structural reasons why Tunisia has progressed politically while Egypt has seemingly returned to its pharaonic roots (as many commentators like to describe its penchant for authoritarian leaders) .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The most prominent are the exponentially greater power of the Egyptian military vis-a-vis its North African counterpart and its far larger, and poorer, population .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But I would argue that the centrality, at least politically, of human rights to the national discourse has been one of the unheralded heroes of the post- revolutionary period .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just compare Tunisia and its president with the situation in Egypt .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Abdel Basset Hassan, head of the Arab Institute for Human Rights in Tunis and a long-time resident of Cairo, explained to me when we met in September , human rights are clearly being institutionalised to a strong degree .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The problem is that human rights is a frail political discourse .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whether in the most ""advanced"" democracies like the United States and UK, or developing countries like Egypt and Tunisia , it's easily swept aside by appeals to core national and/or religious identities and the creation of threats whose defeat inevitably requires watering down the protections afforded to all citizens .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More broadly, human rights exists in a contradictory political framework : In most societies they both require revolutionary change to be fully implemented and yet are routinely violated in revolutionary situations where one form of power is, more or less violently , overpowering and superseding another .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As revolutions from Iran to Cuba have shown , its all too easy for revolutions fought in the name of human rights, justice and dignity to themselves produce violent and repressive systems .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What's more , human rights is intimately tied to a notion of individual personhood that can all too easily be hijacked to a kind of market fundamentalist liberalism in which broad political freedom masks incredibly deep and destruction inequalities, exploitation, and repression - whether of colonised peoples ""outremer"" or of working classes at home .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet ,  for anyone who's experienced the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions in action , the power and importance of human rights is undeniable .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It remains one of the most radical concepts of the modern era; first , because it demands recognising others as inherently equal to oneself regardless of their differences - ethnic, racial, gender, religion, class, or nation .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second ,  they demand strict limitation on state power which is inherently and , unless checked , normatively abusive of citizens .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And this is where the situation in Tunisia remains perilous despite the smooth parliamentary and presidential elections of the last two months .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While Marzouki's Congress for the Republic party represents a poorer and more traditional (and southern) component of Tunisian society , Essebsi's Nida Tounes Party is not merely tied to the old regime, but to the international financial interests to which it was beholden .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  the main threat in Tunisia today, in this regard, is not a religious - secular divide but left-neoliberal, with the two powerful parties working together to suppress all opposition to once again making Tunisia the Arab world's ""poster child"" for a ""broken down"" neoliberal reform model which has always produced - and masked - the desperate inequalities that led to the revolution against Ben Ali in the first place .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For decades, neoliberalism has produced the same results most everywhere it has been implemented: aggregate growth that mask growing inequality, increasing corruption, crime, environmental degradation and repression .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The only check on such policies would be a strong and united left (the opposite of the present situation, by some accounts) centred broadly on labour rights, a fair distribution of wealth and resources and fighting against the corruption that fatally weakened the previous state .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But one of the signature strengths of neoliberal ideologies, from Kansas to Cairo, is precisely how efficiently they motivate people to support leaders and policies that are manifestly against their economic interests .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Nida Tounes-Nahda alignment would provide a powerful ideological and political cover for retrenching the policies that brought Tunisia to the brink of revolution .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the other hand ,  there are more positive countervailing forces at work in Tunis that are cause for long-term hope .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This process is exemplified by the establishment of Dar Essaida, or Saida House, a human rights centre located in and emerging from the local community in one of Tunis' poorest quarters .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Hassan explained , encouraging the poor and working class to (re) define the political and cultural discourses of human rights in ways that reflect their struggles and desires marks an important moment in the evolution of human rights practice .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""It's about implementing a complete vision , and as important , getting it out to the widest public,"" Hassan declared .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""This is the only way to strengthen advances in areas such as women's rights or constitutional reforms .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But the culture is harder to change , and you can't just root out all the networks of the former mafia state in one year, or even ten .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's a long process and it's not fruitful to use the angle of 'better or worse' to judge it now.""",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It has been a week of air strikes ""whodunnit"" mysteries in the Middle East .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, Al Jazeera broke the news that Iranian F-4 Phantoms were bombing ISIL in Iraq .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Iranians initially denied being in the same airspace bombing the same enemies as the Americans but later came clean about their role to the Guardian .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We've also heard rumours of the US A-10 ""tank buster"" arriving to support the US mission in Iraq although , again ,  nothing has been confirmed at this point .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then ,  on as normal a Sunday as Damascus has experienced in the last few years , the Syrian regime released grainy photographs supposedly showing the trails of Israeli aircraft following a bombing run on targets in the area .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Among the rumoured sites that were hit were areas of Damascus International Airport .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This caps a busy weekend for Syria's airbases which withstood ISIL attacks in the east of the country on Saturday .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While at a tactical level it is impossible to understand what impact the strikes have had , at a political level it works for all sides .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Syrian regime has used its conflict with Israel to justify an internal state of emergency and restrictions to freedoms for decades and can now sell to the war weary public who remain in their controlled areas , the twin threat of ISIL and Israeli ""terrorism"" .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Benjamin Netanyahu, with elections looming, there is no better time for Israel's prime minister to act ""prime ministerial"" and remind voters of his eternal vigilance of the threat coming from Syria .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indeed ,  earlier in the week, Netanyahu said that Israel ""is following the Middle East and what is happening very closely, with wide open eyes and ears - and a lot is happening ... We will continue to keep our fingers on the pulse and we will deal with these threats and these challenges , which never take time off"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a letter to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Syria's foreign ministry claimed the bombing happened to distract from the break up of Netanyahu's coalition .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Israeli officials meanwhile, would neither confirm nor deny the attacks with an Israeli army spokesman saying he would not comment on the ""foreign reports"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While Syrian state media should always be read with a healthy pinch of salt , if confirmed , the latest Israeli attack comes in a series that preceded the outbreak of civil war .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a certain format to this low level state of eternal conflict between the two parties .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Israel's September 2007 attack on Syria's al-Kibar facility was again initially unconfirmed but would eventually be told as a strategic masterstroke taking down Syria's nuclear programme at a critical time .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Following the attacks , Syria responded with bombastic rhetoric over what it would do in the face of the strikes but nothing ever happened .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the Syrian uprising and civil war, Israel's primary concern has been with certain types of hi-tech weaponry going to Hezbollah , which was used to explain strikes in January and May of 2013 .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A year later and Israel responded to the very physical spillover of the Syrian conflict by launching strikes in June 2014 after shells were fired at their positions on the Golan Heights .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Syria responded to the January bombings by warning of a ""surprise"" , but in fact their actual reaction has been predictably mute .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The airspace over Syria has never been busier with different nations pursuing different enemies with metrics of success hard to distinguish among the smoke and debris of the destruction .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This weekend's attacks , if they are eventually claimed by Israel , would further entrench the growing irrelevance of many of the region's borders as recognised and respected lines .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While the focus of global attention has been on ISIL's dismantling of the Iraq-Syria border , the Lebanon-Syria border is also becoming functionally blurred and clearly no longer deters Israel's strategic decision makers .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the most immediate level, the strikes will likely embolden Assad to play a traditional nationalist card to strengthen support among his remaining loyalists .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over in Israel , Netanyahu can appear to be making statesmanlike decisions ahead of a likely bruising election and it cannot be a coincidence that he was in the US when the bombing happened - a nod perhaps to a US green light and the durability of that continued relationship .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"During a radio interview this week, French President Francois Hollande said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""doesn't want to annex eastern Ukraine  - he told me that"" .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He even suggested that western sanctions should be eased .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hollande's naivety harks back to George W Bush's infamous comments about Putin in 2001 .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When asked by a reporter if he could trust Putin , he responded ; ""I looked the man in the eye .",testimony,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy ... I was able to get a sense of his soul."" As a former KGB officer, Putin probably looked into Bush's eyes and saw a case number!  In reality ,  Putin has done nothing to demonstrate that his commitment to Hollande is genuine .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crimea is still under the control of Russia after its illegal annexation last year .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Moscow continues to occupy the Georgian breakaway provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russian weapons and equipment are still pouring into eastern Ukraine .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As recently as last November, NATO confirmed another build-up of Russian military equipment and troops inside Ukraine .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia's next moves .,no-unit,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In light of Russia's recent behaviour, what can be expected in eastern Ukraine in 2015? Predictions of this sort are almost impossible and are usually invariably wrong .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However ,  it is possible to develop various scenarios that could offer a glimpse into what Russia's plans might be .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia's ultimate goal is to keep Ukraine out of the transatlantic community - the EU and NATO .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia will also want to consolidate the gains made by separatist forces in eastern Ukraine .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To this end, Russia will have short-term and long term goals .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The primary short-term goal for Russia in Ukraine will be to keep the conflict in eastern Ukraine ""frozen"" - meaning that while the bullets might stop flying , there will be no real effort to bring a conclusive end to the conflict .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This equates to victory for Moscow and defeat for Kiev because it leaves Ukraine not in control of all its territory .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia can also use the ""frozen"" status of separatist-controlled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as bargaining chips in future talks with the West on other issues .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In terms of Russia's longer term goals in Ukraine for 2015 and beyond, there are a number of scenarios that can play out .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is safe to assume that Moscow will help the separatists consolidate gains in Donetsk and Luhansk to create a political entity that becomes more like a viable state .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This will be no easy task and will require the capture of important communication and transit nodes, such as Donetsk airport, the city of Mariupol and its port, and the Luhansk power plant .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These are still under Ukrainian government control but are all needed if the separatists want to achieve true autonomy .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A more ambitious scenario might see Russia expanding separatist-controlled areas to include the entire eastern region of Ukraine consisting of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and the eastern sections of Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv oblasts .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This would require capturing Kharkiv , which is Ukraine's second largest city .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kharkiv also holds a certain degree of symbolism for those in Moscow dreaming of the days of Soviet glory - it was the first city in Ukraine to recognise the Bolshevik takeover in 1917 .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most aggressive scenario might see Moscow attempting to re-establish control of the historical Novorossiya region in modern-day southern Ukraine .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This would create a land bridge between Russia and Crimea  - eventually linking up with the Russian-backed Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This would be no easy undertaking and would require the capture of the heavily defended cities of Mariupol and Odessa, Ukraine's tenth-largest and third- largest cities, respectively .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia is desperate to establish a land bridge to Crimea since the cost of providing goods and services by sea and air to the peninsula is becoming prohibitively expensive .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact ,  Putin has ordered a bridge linking the Russian mainland with Crimea to be built by 2018 .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With an economy in recession, the collapse of the rouble, and the low price of oil , finding the $5.2bn required to build the bridge might not be possible .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead ,  Russia could be forced into creating a land bridge to Crimea .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Out of all of Russia's previous leaders, Putin has more in common with Russia's imperial czars than he does with the Soviet premiers .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perhaps Putin has most in common with Emperor Nicolas I who ruled Russia between 1825 and 1855 .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nicolas I's reign was marked by a stagnate economy, territorial expansions in the Caucasus, the crushing of political dissent, and a war in Crimea .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the case of Nicolas I, his war in Crimea was disastrous and could have had serious implications for his rule if he had not died from pneumonia before the war ended .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will Crimea prove the same for Putin today? Only time will tell .,assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One thing is for certain : Russia's designs on eastern Ukraine are far from over, 2015 will prove to be a very interesting year .",assumption,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was very aggressive noise .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We did not have time to even imagine what it could be .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Within moments as the noise got closer to our class room our teacher told us to hide beneath our desks .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The whole classroom started asking our teacher ""what is happening"" .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Screaming children from the classrooms next door shocked us .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of my friends started falling down (after being hit) .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many of us went under our tables .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I knew I was going to die and started crying .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everyone was on the ground .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maybe, they knew many of us were alive .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bullets went over our heads .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I knew it was the terrorist .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I knew it was Taliban .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My friend also got hit with bullets .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know which parts of his body but he didn't speak .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I could hear him breath next to me .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One terrorist screamed to the other , ""Is that one dead?"" and then I heard bullets and more shots .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I felt like I was dead .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They spoke in Pashto and were wearing shalwar kameez .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of them had long brown beards .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When they left the room , I whispered to Irfan , but he didn't respond .",anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought he is playing dead .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I continued (to play dead) .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was very scared they will come back .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know when my friend died .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He saved my life .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought I was dead but my heart was beating very fast .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I couldn't move .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I played dead for several hours .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I did not know if they were real soldiers .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was very scared .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I heard constant noise of bullets outside my class but didn't have the strength to open my eyes .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was huge explosion .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought the world will explode today .,anecdote,aljazeera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
